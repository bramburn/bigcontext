- **Verify Database**: Check that the database contains indexed data
- **Review Filters**: Ensure file filters aren't excluding relevant files

#### Performance Issues
- **Reduce Chunk Size**: Smaller chunks may improve performance
- **Limit File Types**: Index only necessary file types
- **Check Resources**: Monitor CPU and memory usage
- **Database Performance**: Ensure database server has adequate resources

<prd>Of course. I've analyzed the extensive list of user stories and have grouped them into three logical, sequential themes. This approach will allow us to incrementally deliver high-value features, starting with the most impactful user experience improvements.

Here is the first set of PRDs for the **Core UX Enhancements**.

-----

### **New Document: PRD 1: Foundational - Core UX Enhancements**

**1. Title & Overview**

  * **Project:** Code Context Engine - Core UX Enhancements
  * **Summary:** This phase focuses on significantly improving the day-to-day user experience of the extension. We will introduce a persistent status bar indicator for at-a-glance feedback, create an interactive and human-friendly search results view, and add advanced features like result pagination and an enhanced search history.
  * **Dependencies:** Requires the existing SvelteKit frontend and the backend search API (`ContextService`) to be functional.

-----

**2. Goals & Success Metrics**

  * **Business Objectives:**
      * Increase daily user engagement by making the extension more intuitive and informative.
      * Reduce the time it takes for a user to find and act upon a search result.
  * **User Success Metrics:**
      * 75% of users interact with the rich search results (e.g., clicking to open a file) instead of just copying text.
      * User session duration increases by 20% due to the improved usability of the search history and pagination.
      * The status bar indicator is cited as a helpful feature in user feedback.

-----

**3. User Personas**

  * **Devin (Developer - End User):** Devin wants the extension to feel like a natural part of VS Code. He needs clear, immediate feedback on the system's status and wants his search results to be easy to navigate and act upon without cumbersome copy-pasting.
  * **Frank (Frontend Developer):** Frank is responsible for implementing the UI. He needs clear specifications for the new interactive components, state management logic for features like toggling views, and a plan for handling lists of data with pagination.

**4. Requirements Breakdown**

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: UX** | **Sprint 1: Status Bar & Guided Tour** | As Devin, I want to see the current status of the Code Context Engine in the VS Code status bar, so that I know if it's ready, indexing, or has an error without having to open the sidebar panel. | 1. A new status bar item is added to the VS Code UI.\<br/\>2. The item displays an icon and text representing the current state (e.g., `$(zap) Ready`, `$(sync~spin) Indexing`, `$(error) Error`).\<br/\>3. Clicking the status bar item opens the main webview panel. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As a first-time user, I want a brief, interactive tour of the UI after my first successful index, so that I can quickly learn how to use the core features. | 1. After the first indexing completes, a guided tour overlay is shown.\<br/\>2. The tour highlights the query input box, the results area, and the settings icon.\<br/\>3. The user can easily dismiss the tour or step through it. | |
| **Phase 1: UX** | **Sprint 2: Interactive Search Results** | As a user, I want the search results to be interactive cards, so that I can explore my code directly from the UI. | 1. Each search result is displayed as a distinct card.\<br/\>2. The card contains a code snippet with syntax highlighting.\<br/\>3. Clicking the file path on the card opens the file in a new editor tab at the correct line.\<br/\>4. Each card has a "Copy Snippet" button that copies the code to the clipboard. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As a power user, I want to be able to switch between a user-friendly view of the results and the raw `repomix`-style XML output, so that I can use the best format for my current task. | 1. A toggle switch (e.g., "UI" / "XML") is added to the results view.\<br/\>2. The default view is the user-friendly card layout.\<br/\>3. Toggling to "XML" displays the raw XML output from the backend in a `<pre>` block.\<br/\>4. The user's preference is remembered for the duration of the session. | |
| **Phase 1: UX** | **Sprint 3: Search History & Pagination** | As a user, I want to see my search history with more context, so that I can easily re-run previous queries. | 1. The search history is displayed when the query input is empty.\<br/\>2. Each history item shows the query string, the number of results found, and a timestamp.\<br/\>3. Clicking a history item re-runs that query.\<br/\>4. Search history is persisted across sessions. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As a user, I want the results to be paginated if there are too many, so that the UI remains fast and I'm not overwhelmed. | 1. If a query returns more than a set number of results (e.g., 20), only the first page is displayed.\<br/\>2. A "Load More" button is shown at the end of the results list.\<br/\>3. Clicking "Load More" fetches and appends the next page of results to the list.\<br/\>4. The button is hidden when all results have been loaded. | |

**5. Timeline & Sprints**

  * **Total Estimated Time:** 6 Weeks
  * **Sprint 1:** Status Bar & Guided Tour (2 Weeks)
  * **Sprint 2:** Interactive Search Results (2 Weeks)
  * **Sprint 3:** Search History & Pagination (2 Weeks)

-----

**6. Risks & Assumptions**

  * **Risk:** The logic for incremental updates to the status bar could be complex, especially with multiple asynchronous operations running.
      * **Mitigation:** Rely on the `StateManager` as the single source of truth. The status bar component should simply subscribe to state changes and update its display accordingly.
  * **Risk:** Implementing client-side syntax highlighting for code snippets could impact UI performance.
      * **Mitigation:** Use a lightweight and fast syntax highlighting library (e.g., `highlight.js` or `prism.js`) and ensure it runs efficiently within the Svelte component lifecycle.
  * **Assumption:** The backend API can be modified to support pagination for search results (e.g., by accepting `page` and `pageSize` parameters).

### **New Document: Sub-Sprint 1: Status Bar Indicator**

**Objective:**
To implement a persistent status bar item that provides users with at-a-glance feedback on the extension's state.

**Parent Sprint:**
PRD 1, Sprint 1: Status Bar & Guided Tour

**Tasks:**

1.  **Create `StatusBarManager.ts`:** Develop a new manager class responsible for creating and updating the VS Code status bar item.
2.  **Subscribe to `StateManager`:** The `StatusBarManager` will subscribe to events from the `StateManager` to know when to update.
3.  **Implement State Logic:** Update the status bar's text, icon, tooltip, and command based on the current state (e.g., `Ready`, `Indexing`, `Error`).
4.  **Integrate into `ExtensionManager`:** Instantiate the `StatusBarManager` during the extension's activation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  * A status bar item appears in the bottom-left of the VS Code window.
  * The icon and text change correctly when the extension's state changes.
  * Clicking the status bar item opens the main extension panel.

**Dependencies:**

  * A functional `StateManager` must be in place.

**Timeline:**

  * **Start Date:** 2025-08-27
  * **End Date:** 2025-09-02

### **New Document: Sub-Sprint 2: Guided Tour**

**Objective:**
To create a simple, dismissible guided tour for users who have completed their first indexing run.

**Parent Sprint:**
PRD 1, Sprint 1: Status Bar & Guided Tour

**Tasks:**

1.  **Create `GuidedTour.svelte` component:** Build a Svelte component that can display an overlay with highlighted sections and descriptive text.
2.  **Implement Tour State:** The tour will have multiple steps, managed by local component state.
3.  **Trigger Tour:** The `IndexingView.svelte` component, upon receiving the "indexing complete" event for the first time, will trigger the tour.
4.  **Persist Tour Completion:** After the user completes or dismisses the tour, set a flag in `vscode.ExtensionContext.globalState` to ensure it doesn't appear again.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  * The tour appears automatically after the very first successful indexing.
  * The tour correctly highlights the key UI elements.
  * The tour does not appear on subsequent indexing runs.

**Dependencies:**

  * The `IndexingView.svelte` component must be able to signal completion.

**Timeline:**

  * **Start Date:** 2025-09-03
  * **End Date:** 2025-09-09

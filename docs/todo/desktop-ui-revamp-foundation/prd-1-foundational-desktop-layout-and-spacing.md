## PRD 1: Foundational Desktop Layout and Spacing

### 1. Title & Overview
- Project: Desktop UI Revamp - Foundation
- Summary: This phase establishes the foundational desktop-oriented layout and spacing improvements for the React webview. The current constrained max-width layout will be replaced with an expansive, desktop-first design that better utilizes screen real estate while maintaining proper spacing for high-density content and precise mouse/trackpad interactions.
- Dependencies: Existing React components in webview-react/src/, Tailwind CSS configuration, Radix UI components.

### 2. Goals & Success Metrics
- Business Objectives:
  - Improve user experience for desktop users by making better use of available screen space.
  - Enhance visual hierarchy and content organization for complex desktop workflows.
  - Establish consistent spacing patterns that support high-density information display.
- Developer & System Success Metrics:
  - Layout utilizes full viewport width without horizontal scrolling on standard desktop resolutions (1920x1080+).
  - Spacing system reduces visual clutter while maintaining readability.
  - Component rendering performance remains stable with increased content density.

### 3. User Personas
- Desktop Developer: A developer using the VS Code extension on a large monitor who needs to view multiple data types simultaneously and efficiently navigate complex codebases.
- Power User: An advanced user who customizes their workspace layout and expects desktop application patterns like resizable panels and contextual sidebars.

### 4. Requirements Breakdown
| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Phase 1: Foundation | Sprint 1: Layout Expansion | As a Desktop Developer, I want the main layout to utilize full screen width so I can view more content simultaneously. | 1. Remove max-width constraints from AppRoot.tsx main container.<br>2. Implement responsive grid system for content organization.<br>3. Ensure no horizontal scrolling on 1920px+ widths.<br>4. Maintain minimum 16px padding on viewport edges. | 2 Weeks |
|  |  | As a Desktop Developer, I want improved spacing hierarchy to better organize content visually. | 1. Implement consistent spacing scale (4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px).<br>2. Reduce excessive padding in views (from p-4 to p-2 where appropriate).<br>3. Optimize gap spacing in flex layouts for tighter content flow.<br>4. Apply high-density spacing to data-heavy components like search results. |  |
|  |  | As a Power User, I want resizable panels to customize my workspace layout. | 1. Add resizable sidebar component using Radix UI primitives.<br>2. Implement persistent layout state across sessions.<br>3. Support minimum/maximum width constraints for usability.<br>4. Provide visual feedback during resize operations. |  |
| Phase 1: Foundation | Sprint 2: Component Spacing Optimization | As a Desktop Developer, I want optimized component spacing for better content density. | 1. Update Button component with tighter padding (reduce h-9 to h-8).<br>2. Optimize Input component spacing for inline forms.<br>3. Implement compact variants for data tables and lists.<br>4. Reduce vertical spacing in stacked components (space-y-4 to space-y-2). | 2 Weeks |
|  |  | As a Desktop Developer, I want consistent margin and padding patterns across all views. | 1. Establish spacing tokens in Tailwind config.<br>2. Update all view components to use consistent spacing.<br>3. Implement responsive spacing that adapts to content density.<br>4. Document spacing guidelines for future components. |  |
|  |  | As a Power User, I want disclosure groups for collapsible content sections. | 1. Implement Collapsible components for expandable sections.<br>2. Add keyboard navigation support for disclosure controls.<br>3. Provide visual indicators for expanded/collapsed states.<br>4. Maintain accessibility standards with proper ARIA attributes. |  |

### 5. Timeline & Sprints
- Total Estimated Time: 4 Weeks
- Sprint 1: Layout Expansion (2 Weeks)
- Sprint 2: Component Spacing Optimization (2 Weeks)

### 6. Risks & Assumptions
- Assumption: The current Tailwind configuration supports the required spacing modifications without conflicts.
- Risk: Full-width layout may cause readability issues on very wide monitors (>2560px).
  - Mitigation: Implement responsive breakpoints that maintain reasonable max-widths on ultra-wide displays.
- Risk: Tighter spacing may impact mobile responsiveness if not handled properly.
  - Mitigation: Use responsive utilities to maintain appropriate spacing on smaller screens.
- Risk: Resizable panels may introduce complexity in state management.
  - Mitigation: Start with simple resizable implementation and expand in Phase 2.

### 7. Success Metrics
- Layout utilizes 90%+ of viewport width on desktop resolutions.
- User feedback indicates improved content visibility and organization.
- No performance degradation from layout changes.
- Consistent spacing applied across all major components.

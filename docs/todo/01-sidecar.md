Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can see that the state management is already quite robust with a comprehensive StateManager that includes persistence, subscriptions, validation, and error handling. However, there are opportunities for enhancement. The FastAPI sidecar is a new addition that will require creating a Python service from scratch.

Here are the sequential PRDs for this project:

## PRD 1: Foundational State Management Enhancements

**1. Title & Overview**
- **Project:** State Management Robustness Improvements
- **Summary:** Enhance the existing StateManager with advanced features for better reliability, error recovery, and state validation. This builds on the already solid foundation to make the extension even more robust.
- **Dependencies:** Existing StateManager implementation in `src/stateManager.ts`

**2. Goals & Success Metrics**
- **Business Objectives:**
  - Improve extension stability by adding comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
  - Enhance debugging capabilities with state change history and validation
  - Reduce state-related crashes and data corruption incidents
- **Developer Success Metrics:**
  - State validation catches 95% of invalid state transitions
  - Error recovery mechanisms restore valid state in 90% of failure scenarios
  - State change history enables debugging of complex state issues

**3. User Personas**
- **Alex (System Administrator):** Needs the extension to be highly reliable and recover gracefully from state corruption
- **David (Backend Developer):** Requires detailed state debugging information when troubleshooting issues
- **Nina (New Developer):** Needs clear error messages and automatic recovery when state issues occur

**4. Requirements Breakdown**

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
|-------|--------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | **Sprint 1: State Validation & Recovery** | As Alex, I want the StateManager to validate state transitions and recover from invalid states automatically. | 1. State validation schema is implemented with JSON schema validation.<br/>2. Invalid state transitions are blocked with clear error messages.<br/>3. Automatic recovery attempts restore valid state from backups.<br/>4. Recovery events are logged with detailed context. | 2 Weeks |
| | | As David, I want to see a history of state changes for debugging complex issues. | 1. State change history is maintained with timestamps and change details.<br/>2. History can be queried programmatically and exported for analysis.<br/>3. History size is configurable with automatic cleanup of old entries.<br/>4. State change events include metadata about the source of changes. | |
| | | As Nina, I want clear error messages when state operations fail, with suggestions for resolution. | 1. All state operation errors include descriptive messages and error codes.<br/>2. Error messages suggest specific actions for recovery.<br/>3. Error context includes relevant state information for debugging.<br/>4. Error logging includes stack traces and state snapshots. | |
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | **Sprint 2: Advanced State Features** | As Alex, I want the StateManager to support state migrations when the schema changes. | 1. State migration system handles schema version changes.<br/>2. Migration scripts are versioned and tested.<br/>3. Failed migrations can be rolled back automatically.<br/>4. Migration progress is tracked and reported. | 2 Weeks |
| | | As David, I want to be able to undo state changes programmatically. | 1. Undo/redo functionality for state changes.<br/>2. Undo operations are validated before execution.<br/>3. Undo history is maintained separately from state history.<br/>4. Undo operations can be batched for complex state changes. | |

**5. Timeline & Sprints**
- **Total Estimated Time:** 4 Weeks
- **Sprint 1:** State Validation & Recovery (2 Weeks)
- **Sprint 2:** Advanced State Features (2 Weeks)

**6. Risks & Assumptions**
- **Assumption:** The current StateManager architecture can be extended without breaking existing functionality
- **Risk:** State validation might impact performance for high-frequency state changes
  - **Mitigation:** Implement debounced validation and caching for frequently accessed state
- **Risk:** State history storage could grow too large
  - **Mitigation:** Implement configurable history limits and automatic cleanup

## PRD 2: FastAPI Sidecar Service Implementation

**1. Title & Overview**
- **Project:** FastAPI Sidecar Service for VSCode Extension
- **Summary:** Create a Python FastAPI service that runs as a sidecar process to the VSCode extension, providing REST API endpoints for advanced functionality. The service will have dynamic port assignment and be registered for easy access by both frontend and extension components.
- **Dependencies:** Python 3.8+, FastAPI, Uvicorn

**2. Goals & Success Metrics**
- **Business Objectives:**
  - Enable advanced backend processing capabilities within the VSCode environment
  - Provide a scalable architecture for adding new features without VSCode extension limitations
  - Create a foundation for AI/ML processing and complex computations
- **Developer Success Metrics:**
  - Sidecar service starts successfully within 5 seconds of extension activation
  - Dynamic port assignment works reliably across different environments
  - Service registration enables seamless communication from frontend and extension

**3. User Personas**
- **David (Backend Developer):** Needs to add complex processing capabilities that aren't suitable for VSCode extension context
- **Nina (New Developer):** Wants a clean API for accessing advanced features without dealing with inter-process communication complexity
- **Alex (System Administrator):** Requires reliable service lifecycle management and monitoring

**4. Requirements Breakdown**

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
|-------|--------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Phase 2: Sidecar** | **Sprint 3: FastAPI Service Foundation** | As David, I want to create a basic FastAPI service that can be launched as a sidecar process. | 1. Python FastAPI application is created with proper project structure.<br/>2. Service can be started independently with `python main.py`.<br/>3. Basic health check endpoint returns service status.<br/>4. Service includes proper logging and error handling. | 2 Weeks |
| | | As Nina, I want the service to have dynamic port assignment that doesn't conflict with other services. | 1. Port discovery mechanism finds available ports automatically.<br/>2. Port range is configurable with sensible defaults.<br/>3. Port assignment is logged for debugging purposes.<br/>4. Service handles port conflicts gracefully with retry logic. | |
| | | As Alex, I want the sidecar service to integrate cleanly with the VSCode extension lifecycle. | 1. Service can be started/stopped programmatically from the extension.<br/>2. Service process is properly managed and cleaned up on extension deactivation.<br/>3. Service health is monitored and reported to the extension.<br/>4. Service logs are accessible through VSCode output channels. | |
| **Phase 2: Sidecar** | **Sprint 4: Communication & Registration** | As David, I want the sidecar port to be registered and accessible by both frontend and extension. | 1. Port information is stored in a shared location accessible by all components.<br/>2. Frontend can discover and connect to the sidecar service.<br/>3. Extension can communicate with the sidecar for backend operations.<br/>4. Connection failures are handled gracefully with retry mechanisms. | 2 Weeks |
| | | As Nina, I want a simple "hello world" endpoint to verify the sidecar is working. | 1. GET `/hello` endpoint returns a JSON response with service information.<br/>2. Endpoint includes service version, uptime, and port information.<br/>3. Endpoint is documented and easily testable.<br/>4. Response format is consistent with the overall API design. | |
| | | As Alex, I want comprehensive monitoring and health checks for the sidecar service. | 1. Health check endpoint provides detailed service status.<br/>2. Service metrics are exposed for monitoring.<br/>3. Automatic health monitoring detects and reports issues.<br/>4. Service can be restarted automatically on health check failures. | |

**5. Timeline & Sprints**
- **Total Estimated Time:** 4 Weeks
- **Sprint 3:** FastAPI Service Foundation (2 Weeks)
- **Sprint 4:** Communication & Registration (2 Weeks)

**6. Risks & Assumptions**

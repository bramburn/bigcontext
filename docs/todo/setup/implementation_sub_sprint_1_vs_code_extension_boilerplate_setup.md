### Implementation Guide: Sub-Sprint 1 - VS Code Extension Boilerplate Setup

**Objective:** To create the fundamental file structure and configuration for a new VS Code extension using TypeScript.

#### **Analysis**

Since a `repomix-roocode.xml` or similar comprehensive code structure file was not provided for this specific sub-sprint, the analysis is based on the general requirements for a VS Code extension and best practices for project setup. The goal is to establish a clean, maintainable, and standard TypeScript-based extension project.

#### **Prerequisites and Setup**

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Node.js and npm/yarn:** Essential for JavaScript/TypeScript development.
2.  **VS Code Extension Generator (`yo code`):** This Yeoman generator scaffolds new VS Code extension projects.
    ```bash
    npm install -g yo generator-code
    ```

#### **Implementation Guide**

Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up the VS Code extension boilerplate:

**1. Generate the VS Code Extension Project**

Use the `yo code` generator to create the initial project structure. This command will prompt you with several questions to configure your extension.

  *   **Command:**
    ```bash
    npx yo code
    ```
  *   **Prompts to select:**
      *   `? What type of extension do you want to create?` -> `New Extension (TypeScript)`
      *   `? What is the name of your extension?` -> `CodeContextEngine` (or a suitable name)
      *   `? What is the identifier of your extension?` -> `code-context-engine`
      *   `? What is the description of your extension?` -> (Provide a brief description)
      *   `? Enable TypeScript checking and linting?` -> `Yes`
      *   `? Initialize a git repository?` -> `Yes` (Recommended)
      *   `? Do you want to open the new folder with VS Code?` -> `Yes`

  *   **API Information:** The `yo code` generator uses the VS Code Extension API internally to set up the `package.json`, `src/extension.ts`, and other configuration files.

**2. Configure `package.json`**

The `package.json` file is crucial for defining your extension's metadata, commands, and activation events. Review and adjust the generated file.

  *   **File:** `package.json`
  *   **Key fields to review/modify:**
      *   `name`: The unique identifier for your extension.
      *   `displayName`: The name displayed in the VS Code Marketplace.
      *   `description`: A brief summary of your extension.
      *   `publisher`: Your VS Code Marketplace publisher ID.
      *   `activationEvents`: Defines when your extension is activated (e.g., `onCommand:your-extension.helloWorld`).
      *   `main`: The entry point of your extension (usually `out/extension.js`).
      *   `contributes`: This section is where you declare commands, views, keybindings, etc.

  *   **Example `activationEvents` (if not already present):**
    ```json
    "activationEvents": [
        "onCommand:code-context-engine.helloWorld"
    ],
    ```

**3. Establish Project Structure**

The `yo code` generator provides a basic structure. For a SvelteKit frontend, it's good practice to separate the backend (extension) and frontend (webview) code. You'll typically have a `src` directory for your main extension code and a separate directory for your SvelteKit project.

  *   **Action:** Create a `webview` directory at the root level (or within `src` if preferred) to house your SvelteKit application.
  *   **Command:**
    ```bash
    mkdir webview
    ```
  *   **Resulting structure (example):**
    ```
    your-extension-name/
    ├── .vscode/
    ├── src/
    │   └── extension.ts
    ├── webview/  <-- New directory for SvelteKit
    ├── package.json
    ├── tsconfig.json
    ├── .gitignore
    └── ...
    ```

**4. Initial Backend Logic (`extension.ts`)**

The `extension.ts` file is the main entry point for your VS Code extension. It contains the `activate` function, which is called when your extension is activated, and the `deactivate` function, called when your extension is deactivated.

  *   **File:** `src/extension.ts`
  *   **Key concepts:**
      *   `activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext)`: This is where you register commands, create webviews, and set up event listeners.
      *   `deactivate()`: Used for cleanup, like disposing of resources.
      *   `vscode.commands.registerCommand()`: Registers a command that can be invoked by the user (e.g., from the Command Palette).
      *   `vscode.window.showInformationMessage()`: Displays a message to the user.
      *   `context.subscriptions.push()`: Adds disposables (objects with a `dispose` method) to the extension's context, ensuring they are cleaned up when the extension is deactivated.

  *   **Example `src/extension.ts` (as generated by `yo code` and slightly modified for clarity):**
    ```typescript
    import * as vscode from 'vscode';

    /**
     * This method is called when your extension is activated.
     * The extension is activated the very first time the command is executed.
     */
    export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {

        // Use the console to output diagnostic information (console.log) and errors (console.error)
        // This line of code will only be executed once when your extension is activated
        console.log('Congratulations, your extension "code-context-engine" is now active!');

        // The command has been defined in the package.json file
        // Now provide the implementation of the command with registerCommand
        // The commandId parameter must match the command field in package.json
        let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('code-context-engine.helloWorld', () => {
            // The code you place here will be executed every time your command is executed
            // Display a message box to the user
            vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Hello World from Code Context Engine!');
        });

        context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
    }

    /**
     * This method is called when your extension is deactivated
     */
    export function deactivate() {}
    ```

This completes the foundational setup for your VS Code extension. You now have a runnable project with a basic command, ready for further development in subsequent sprints.

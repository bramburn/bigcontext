# Sub-Sprint 8: Graceful Degradation

**Objective:**
To implement graceful degradation mechanisms that provide reduced but functional capabilities when network conditions are poor or connections are unreliable.

**Parent Sprint:**
PRD 2, Sprint 4: Performance Optimization & Caching

**Tasks:**

1. **Implement Offline Mode:**
   - Create offline-capable UI with cached data
   - Implement service worker for asset caching
   - Provide read-only functionality when disconnected
   - Queue user actions for when connection is restored

2. **Add Bandwidth Detection:**
   - Implement connection speed detection
   - Adapt UI complexity based on bandwidth
   - Reduce animations and visual effects on slow connections
   - Switch to text-only mode for very slow connections

3. **Create Queue-Based Message Handling:**
   - Queue messages when connection is unreliable
   - Implement message retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Provide user feedback on queued operations
   - Handle message ordering and deduplication

4. **Implement Degraded Mode UI:**
   - Create simplified UI for degraded conditions
   - Provide clear indication of degraded mode status
   - Offer manual refresh and recovery options
   - Maintain core functionality with reduced features

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Offline mode provides read-only access to cached data
- Bandwidth detection accurately identifies connection quality
- UI adapts appropriately to different connection speeds
- Message queuing prevents data loss during poor connectivity
- Degraded mode clearly communicates limitations to users
- Recovery mechanisms restore full functionality when possible

**Dependencies:**

- Sub-Sprint 7 must be complete (performance optimization functional)
- Caching system must be implemented and working
- Connection monitoring from Sub-Sprint 5 must be functional

**Timeline:**

- **Start Date:** Week 4, Day 5
- **End Date:** Week 4, Day 7

**Files to Create/Modify:**

- All webview implementations (offline mode and degradation logic)
- Service worker files for asset caching
- `src/webviewManager.ts` (degraded mode coordination)

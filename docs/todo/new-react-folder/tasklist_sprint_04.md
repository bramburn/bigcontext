# Task List: Sprint 4 - Performance Optimization & Caching

**Goal:** To implement performance optimizations, caching mechanisms, and graceful degradation for optimal webview performance across all network conditions.

| Task ID | Status | Task Description (Sequential & Atomic Steps) | File(s) To Modify |
|---------|--------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **4.1** | ☐ To Do | **Optimize Vite/Rollup Configurations:** Update build configurations for all implementations to minimize bundle size and HTTP requests through code splitting and tree shaking. | `webview-react/vite.config.ts`, `webview-simple/vite.config.ts`, `webview/vite.config.ts` |
| **4.2** | ☐ To Do | **Implement Critical CSS Inlining:** Bundle critical CSS inline to prevent render blocking and improve initial load performance. | All webview build configurations |
| **4.3** | ☐ To Do | **Add Progressive Loading System:** Implement lazy loading for heavy components with loading placeholders and skeleton screens. | All webview implementations |
| **4.4** | ☐ To Do | **Create Local Caching System:** Implement browser storage for static assets with cache versioning, invalidation logic, and size limits. | All webview implementations |
| **4.5** | ☐ To Do | **Implement Service Worker:** Create service worker for offline asset caching and improved performance in disconnected scenarios. | All webview implementations, service worker files |
| **4.6** | ☐ To Do | **Add Bandwidth Detection:** Implement connection speed detection to adapt UI complexity based on available bandwidth. | All webview implementations |
| **4.7** | ☐ To Do | **Create Adaptive UI System:** Implement UI complexity reduction for slow connections, including animation reduction and text-only modes. | All webview implementations |
| **4.8** | ☐ To Do | **Implement Offline Mode:** Create offline-capable UI with cached data access and read-only functionality when disconnected. | All webview implementations |
| **4.9** | ☐ To Do | **Add Queue-Based Message Handling:** Implement message queuing for unreliable connections with retry logic and user feedback. | All webview implementations |
| **4.10** | ☐ To Do | **Create Degraded Mode UI:** Implement simplified UI for poor network conditions with clear status indication and recovery options. | All webview implementations |
| **4.11** | ☐ To Do | **Optimize Asset Compression:** Enable gzip compression, reduce image sizes, and implement responsive images for bandwidth optimization. | All webview build configurations and assets |
| **4.12** | ☐ To Do | **Add Performance Monitoring Integration:** Integrate performance optimizations with health monitoring system for continuous performance tracking. | All webview implementations, `src/webviewManager.ts` |
| **4.13** | ☐ To Do | **Test Performance in Remote SSH:** Validate that performance optimizations achieve target load times (under 3 seconds) in Remote SSH environments. | Remote SSH Environment Testing |
| **4.14** | ☐ To Do | **Verify Graceful Degradation:** Test that degraded mode provides usable functionality under poor network conditions and recovers properly. | Network Simulation Testing |
| **4.15** | ☐ To Do | **Measure Performance Improvements:** Establish baseline measurements and verify that optimizations achieve target improvements (30% bundle reduction, 50% cache improvement). | Performance Testing and Metrics |

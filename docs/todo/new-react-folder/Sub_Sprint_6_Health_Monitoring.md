# Sub-Sprint 6: Health Monitoring

**Objective:**
To implement comprehensive health monitoring and performance metrics collection for proactive identification of webview issues and performance bottlenecks.

**Parent Sprint:**
PRD 2, Sprint 3: Auto-Recovery & Health Monitoring

**Tasks:**

1. **Implement Performance Metrics Collection:**
   - Track webview load times from initialization to ready state
   - Monitor memory usage and detect memory leaks
   - Measure message passing latency and throughput
   - Record resource loading times and failure rates

2. **Create Error Tracking System:**
   - Categorize errors by type (network, API, rendering, etc.)
   - Track error frequency and patterns over time
   - Implement error severity classification
   - Store error context and stack traces for debugging

3. **Add Health Status API:**
   - Create health check endpoint accessible to extension
   - Provide real-time health metrics via message passing
   - Implement health score calculation based on multiple factors
   - Enable external monitoring system integration

4. **Implement Configurable Alerting:**
   - Add threshold configuration for critical metrics
   - Trigger alerts when thresholds are exceeded
   - Provide different alert levels (warning, error, critical)
   - Log alerts to extension output channel and VS Code notifications

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Performance metrics are collected continuously without impacting webview performance
- Error tracking captures sufficient context for debugging
- Health status API provides real-time metrics to extension
- Configurable alerting triggers appropriately for threshold violations
- Metrics data is accessible through extension logging system
- Health monitoring works across all webview implementations

**Dependencies:**

- Sub-Sprint 5 must be complete (auto-recovery system functional)
- CentralizedLoggingService must support structured metrics
- VS Code notification system integration

**Timeline:**

- **Start Date:** Week 3, Day 5
- **End Date:** Week 3, Day 7

**Files to Create/Modify:**

- All webview implementations (metrics collection)
- `src/webviewManager.ts` (health API and alerting)
- `package.json` (health monitoring configuration settings)

# Sub-Sprint 5: Auto-Recovery System

**Objective:**
To implement automatic detection and recovery mechanisms for webview communication failures, ensuring graceful handling of network interruptions and connection issues.

**Parent Sprint:**
PRD 2, Sprint 3: Auto-Recovery & Health Monitoring

**Tasks:**

1. **Implement Connection State Monitoring:**
   - Add connection state tracking to webview implementations
   - Detect when communication with extension is lost
   - Implement heartbeat mechanism for connection verification
   - Track connection quality and latency metrics

2. **Create Automatic Reconnection Logic:**
   - Implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
   - Add maximum retry limits with user notification
   - Preserve webview state during reconnection attempts
   - Queue messages during disconnection periods

3. **Add Connection Status UI:**
   - Display connection status indicator in webview
   - Show reconnection progress and attempt counts
   - Provide manual reconnection option for users
   - Display estimated time to next retry attempt

4. **Implement State Preservation:**
   - Save critical webview state before connection loss
   - Restore state after successful reconnection
   - Handle partial state recovery scenarios
   - Prevent data loss during network interruptions

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Webview automatically detects communication failures within 10 seconds
- Reconnection attempts use exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s max)
- UI clearly indicates connection status and recovery progress
- No data loss occurs during temporary network interruptions
- Manual reconnection option is available to users
- Connection recovery works in both local and Remote SSH environments

**Dependencies:**

- All Phase 1 components must be complete and functional
- Webview implementations must have stable message passing
- Understanding of VS Code webview lifecycle and limitations

**Timeline:**

- **Start Date:** Week 3, Day 1
- **End Date:** Week 3, Day 4

**Files to Create/Modify:**

- All webview implementations (connection monitoring and recovery logic)
- `src/webviewManager.ts` (heartbeat and connection tracking)
- Webview UI components (connection status indicators)

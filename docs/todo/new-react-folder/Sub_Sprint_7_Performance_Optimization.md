# Sub-Sprint 7: Performance Optimization

**Objective:**
To implement performance optimizations including intelligent resource bundling, progressive loading, and caching mechanisms to ensure optimal webview performance in all environments.

**Parent Sprint:**
PRD 2, Sprint 4: Performance Optimization & Caching

**Tasks:**

1. **Implement Intelligent Resource Bundling:**
   - Optimize Vite/Rollup configurations for minimal HTTP requests
   - Implement code splitting for non-critical components
   - Bundle critical CSS inline to prevent render blocking
   - Minimize JavaScript bundle size through tree shaking

2. **Add Progressive Loading System:**
   - Implement lazy loading for heavy UI components
   - Create loading placeholders and skeleton screens
   - Prioritize above-the-fold content loading
   - Defer non-essential feature initialization

3. **Create Local Caching System:**
   - Implement browser storage for static assets
   - Add cache versioning and invalidation logic
   - Cache frequently accessed data and UI state
   - Implement cache size limits and cleanup

4. **Optimize for Low-Bandwidth Connections:**
   - Implement adaptive loading based on connection speed
   - Compress assets and enable gzip where possible
   - Reduce image sizes and implement responsive images
   - Minimize network requests during initial load

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Initial webview load time is under 3 seconds in Remote SSH
- Bundle size is reduced by at least 30% from baseline
- Progressive loading shows content incrementally without blocking
- Caching reduces subsequent load times by at least 50%
- Performance optimizations work across all three implementations
- Low-bandwidth mode provides usable functionality

**Dependencies:**

- Sub-Sprint 6 must be complete (health monitoring functional)
- Build system configurations must be stable
- Performance baseline measurements must be established

**Timeline:**

- **Start Date:** Week 4, Day 1
- **End Date:** Week 4, Day 4

**Files to Create/Modify:**

- All webview build configurations (Vite/Rollup optimization)
- All webview implementations (progressive loading and caching)
- `src/webviewManager.ts` (performance monitoring integration)

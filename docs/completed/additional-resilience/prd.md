Of course. This is an ambitious and well-defined feature set that will transform the Code Context Engine from a foundational tool into a market-leading, intelligent developer assistant. The existing architecture is robust and well-decoupled, providing an excellent foundation for these enhancements.

I have broken down the project into three sequential phases based on your recommended priorities. Each phase will be delivered through a series of granular Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), complete with sprint backlogs, sub-sprint breakdowns, and detailed task lists.

Here is the complete project plan.

-----

### **New Document: PRD 1: Foundational - Critical Infrastructure & Core Intelligence**

**1. Title & Overview**

  * **Project:** Code Context Engine - Critical Infrastructure & Core Intelligence
  * **Summary:** This foundational phase focuses on implementing the most critical features required for a robust, secure, and intelligent search experience. We will build an advanced **Semantic Search Engine**, introduce a resilient **Error Recovery Service** and a proactive **Health Check System**, secure all indexed data with **Data Encryption**, and enhance the user experience with an inline **Search Result Preview**.
  * **Dependencies:** This phase builds directly upon the existing indexing pipeline, Qdrant database service, and the React-based webview.

**2. Goals & Success Metrics**

  * **Business Objectives:**
      * Deliver a highly reliable and secure product that users can trust with their source code.
      * Establish a significant competitive advantage by moving beyond simple text search to true semantic understanding.
  * **Developer & System Success Metrics:**
      * The Semantic Search Engine improves search result relevance (measured by user feedback or internal benchmarks) by over 30% compared to the existing keyword-based search.
      * The Error Recovery Service automatically recovers from at least 80% of transient indexing or search failures without user intervention.
      * The Health Check System correctly identifies and reports on the status of all critical components (database, embedding provider, etc.).
      * All data at rest in the Qdrant database is encrypted, passing a security audit.

**3. User Personas**

  * **Devin (Developer - End User):** Devin needs search results that understand the *intent* of his code, not just the words. When something goes wrong, he expects the tool to be resilient.
  * **Alisha (Backend Developer):** Alisha is responsible for the system's reliability. She needs robust error handling and monitoring to diagnose and prevent issues.
  * **Sarah (Security Engineer):** Sarah is responsible for the security of all tools used in her organization. She requires that all sensitive data, including source code, be encrypted at rest.

**4. Requirements Breakdown**

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Critical** | **Sprint 1: Semantic Search Engine** | As Devin, I want the search engine to understand the context and meaning of my code, so that I get more relevant results than a simple text search. | 1. The `SearchManager` is enhanced to use semantic vector search as the primary query method.\<br\>2. Queries are vectorized using the configured embedding provider.\<br\>3. The UI allows users to see the similarity score of each result. | **2 Weeks** |
| **Phase 1: Critical** | **Sprint 2: System Resilience** | As Alisha, I want a proactive **Health Check System** that validates all system components, so I can detect and fix issues before they impact users. | 1. A new `HealthCheckService` is created that can test connections to the Qdrant database and the embedding provider.\<br\>2. An API endpoint is exposed for the UI to request a health check.\<br\>3. The `DiagnosticsView.tsx` component is updated to display the status of each component. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As Devin, I want an **Error Recovery Service** that automatically retries failed operations, so that transient network issues don't interrupt my workflow. | 1. The `IndexingService` and `SearchManager` are updated to include retry logic with exponential backoff for network-related operations.\<br\>2. The system logs the number of retries for any given operation.\<br\>3. If an operation fails after all retries, a clear error is presented to the user. | |
| **Phase 1: Critical** | **Sprint 3: Security & UX** | As Sarah, I want all indexed code data to be **encrypted at rest**, so that our intellectual property is secure. | 1. The `QdrantService` is configured to enable Qdrant's built-in data encryption features.\<br\>2. All data stored in the Qdrant collection is verified to be encrypted.\<br\>3. The encryption keys are managed securely, preferably through a system like Docker secrets or environment variables. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As Devin, I want to see a **preview of a search result** directly in the results list, so I can evaluate its relevance without opening the file. | 1. The `QueryView.tsx` is updated to include an expandable preview area for each result.\<br\>2. Clicking a result card fetches and displays the relevant code snippet in the preview area with syntax highlighting.\<br\>3. The preview is performant and does not slow down the main results list. | |

**5. Timeline & Sprints**

  * **Total Estimated Time:** 6 Weeks
  * **Sprint 1:** Semantic Search Engine (2 Weeks)
  * **Sprint 2:** System Resilience (2 Weeks)
  * **Sprint 3:** Security & UX (2 Weeks)

**6. Risks & Assumptions**

  * **Assumption:** The Qdrant instance has the necessary configuration options available for enabling encryption.
  * **Risk:** Semantic search performance might be slow on very large codebases.
      * **Mitigation:** Implement efficient vector indexing strategies in Qdrant and optimize the query vectorization process.
  * **Risk:** Overly aggressive error recovery could mask persistent underlying issues.
      * **Mitigation:** The Error Recovery Service must have a maximum retry limit and log all failed attempts for later analysis.

The `IndexingService` is updated to manage multiple, distinct Qdrant collections, one for each repository.\<br\>2. The search UI includes a filter to select which repositories to search across.\<br\>3. The `Configuration` now accepts a list of repository paths to index. | |
| | | As Devin, I want **Git Integration** so that search results are enriched with blame information, helping me understand who last modified a line of code and why. | 1. When a search result is selected, the system uses `git blame` to fetch the author and commit details for that line.\<br\>2. The `QueryView.tsx` preview panel is updated to display the Git blame information.\<br\>3. The integration is efficient and does not significantly slow down result rendering. | |

**5. Timeline & Sprints**

  * **Total Estimated Time:** 4 Weeks
  * **Sprint 4:** Monitoring & Configuration (2 Weeks)
  * **Sprint 5:** Advanced Search & SCM (Source Code Management) (2 Weeks)

**6. Risks & Assumptions**

  * **Team Lead / Architect:** Wants a high-level, visual understanding of the codebase architecture and dependencies to plan future work and identify areas for refactoring.

**4. Requirements Breakdown**

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 3: Enhancement** | **Sprint 6: Code Intelligence** | As a Team Lead, I want a **Code Relationship Mapper** so I can visualize the dependencies and call graph of our codebase. | 1. A new service uses Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to analyze code and identify relationships.\<br\>2. The UI can render an interactive graph (using a library like D3.js or Vis.js) showing function calls and class dependencies.\<br\>3. Users can click on a node in the graph to navigate to the corresponding code. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As Devin, I want **Multi-language Support** so I can use the same powerful search features on my team's Java services. | 1.

**5. Timeline & Sprints**

  * **Total Estimated Time:** 4 Weeks
  * **Sprint 6:** Code Intelligence (2 Weeks)
  * **Sprint 7:** Developer Assistance & Integrations (2 Weeks)

**6. Risks & Assumptions**

  * **Assumption:** We can find reliable open-source libraries for parsing additional languages and generating ASTs.
  * **Risk:** The Code Relationship Mapper could be very complex and computationally expensive for large and tightly coupled codebases.
      * **Mitigation:** Start by visualizing only direct, first-level dependencies and allow users to expand the graph on demand.
  * **Risk:** AI-powered refactoring suggestions could be incorrect or introduce bugs.
      * **Mitigation:** Clearly label suggestions as "experimental" and ensure they are applied only with explicit user consent. Always rely on the user's version control to revert changes.

guidance
Of course. Based on a thorough analysis of your project's PRDs, existing codebase, and extensive web research, here is a comprehensive, sprint-by-sprint guide to implementing the new features for your Code Context Engine.

## **Sprint 1: Semantic Search Engine**

**Objective:** To replace the existing keyword-based search with a more intelligent semantic vector search, providing users with contextually relevant results.

-----

### **High-Level Plan**

1.  **Modify the Backend:** Update the `SearchManager` to convert natural language queries into vector embeddings.
2.  **Perform Vector Search:** Use the generated vector to perform a similarity search in the Qdrant database via the `QdrantService`.
3.  **Update the Frontend:** Enhance the `QueryView.tsx` component to display the similarity score returned by Qdrant for each result.

### **External APIs & Packages**

No new packages are required for this sprint, as it leverages the existing `@qdrant/js-client-rest` and embedding provider infrastructure.

  * **Qdrant Client API Reference**: The key method for this sprint is `search`. It takes a collection name and a vector, and returns a list of the most similar points.
      * [Qdrant-JS Client Documentation](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-js)

### **Code Examples & Guidance**

#### **1. Update `src/searchManager.ts`**

Refactor the `search` method to perform semantic search. It will now take a string query, use the `embeddingProvider` to vectorize it, and then call the `qdrantService`.

```typescript
// src/searchManager.ts
import { EmbeddingProvider } from './embeddings/embeddingProvider';
import { QdrantService, SearchResult } from './db/qdrantService';

export class SearchManager {
    constructor(
        private embeddingProvider: EmbeddingProvider,
        private qdrantService: QdrantService,
        private workspaceRoot: string // Assuming workspace root is available
    ) {}

    public async performSemanticSearch(query: string, limit: number = 20): Promise<SearchResult[]> {
        console.log(`Performing semantic search for: "${query}"`);

        // 1. Generate an embedding for the user's query
        const queryVector = await this.embeddingProvider.generateEmbeddings([query]);
        if (!queryVector || queryVector.length === 0) {
            throw new Error('Failed to generate query embedding.');
        }

        // 2. Use the vector to search in Qdrant
        // The collection name should be determined based on the workspace
        const collectionName = this.getCollectionNameForWorkspace();
        const searchResults = await this.qdrantService.search(
            collectionName,
            queryVector[0],
            limit
        );

        console.log(`Found ${searchResults.length} results from Qdrant.`);
        return searchResults;
    }

    private getCollectionNameForWorkspace(): string {
        // This logic should be robust, perhaps using a hash of the workspace path
        const path = require('path');
        return `vscode_workspace_${path.basename(this.workspaceRoot)}`;
    }
}
```

#### **2. Update `webview-react/src/components/QueryView.tsx`**

Modify the `ResultCard` sub-component within `QueryView.tsx` to display the similarity score.

```tsx
// webview-react/src/components/QueryView.tsx (inside the ResultCard component)
import { Badge } from '@fluentui/react-components';

// ... inside the ResultCard component ...

// Assuming 'result' prop has a 'score' property
const similarityScore = Math.round(result.score * 100);

return (
    <Card>
        <CardHeader
            header={<Text weight="semibold">{result.payload.filePath}</Text>}
            description={<Caption1>Line: {result.payload.startLine}</Caption1>}
            actions={
                <Badge color="informative" shape="rounded">
                    {similarityScore}% match
                </Badge>
            }
        />
        {/* ... rest of the card content ... */}
    </Card>
);
```

### **Verification**

1.  Run the extension and index a repository.
2.  Perform a search with a conceptual query (e.g., "function to handle user login").
3.  Verify in the logs that a vector search is being performed.
4.  Check the `QueryView` UI to ensure that each result card displays a similarity score (e.g., "87% match").

## **Sprint 2: System Resilience**

**Objective:** To build a proactive Health Check System and integrate a resilient Error Recovery Service, making the extension more stable and reliable.

-----

### **High-Level Plan**

1.  **Create `HealthCheckService`:** Develop a new service in the backend to test the connectivity of external dependencies (Qdrant, Embedding Provider).
2.  **Integrate Health Checks into UI:** Expose the health check results via an API endpoint and display them in the existing `DiagnosticsView.tsx`.
3.  **Implement Retry Logic:** Add retry-with-exponential-backoff logic to network-sensitive operations in services like `IndexingService` and `SearchManager`.

### **External APIs & Packages**

  * **`async-retry`**: A robust library for retrying asynchronous operations with exponential backoff. It simplifies the implementation of the Error Recovery Service.
      * **Installation:** `npm install async-retry`
      * [async-retry on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-retry)

### **Code Examples & Guidance**

#### **1. Create `src/validation/healthCheckService.ts`**

This new service will contain methods to check the status of each critical dependency.

```typescript
// src/validation/healthCheckService.ts
import { QdrantService } from '../db/qdrantService';
import { EmbeddingProvider } from '../embeddings/embeddingProvider';

export interface HealthCheckResult {
    service: string;
    status: 'healthy' | 'unhealthy';
    details: string;
}

export class HealthCheckService {
    constructor(
        private qdrantService: QdrantService,
        private embeddingProvider: EmbeddingProvider
    ) {}

    public async runAllChecks(): Promise<HealthCheckResult[]> {
        const results = await Promise.all([
            this.checkQdrant(),
            this.checkEmbeddingProvider(),
        ]);
        return results;
    }

    private async checkQdrant(): Promise<HealthCheckResult> {
        try {
            const isHealthy = await this.qdrantService.healthCheck();
            if (isHealthy) {
                return { service: 'Qdrant DB', status: 'healthy', details: 'Connection successful.' };
            }
            throw new Error('Health check endpoint returned unhealthy status.');
        } catch (error) {
            return { service: 'Qdrant DB', status: 'unhealthy', details: (error as Error).message };
        }
    }

    private async checkEmbeddingProvider(): Promise<HealthCheckResult> {
        try {
            // isAvailable() should be a method on the provider interface
            const isAvailable = await this.embeddingProvider.isAvailable(); 
            if (isAvailable) {
                return { service: 'Embedding Provider', status: 'healthy', details: 'Provider is available.' };
            }
            throw new Error('Provider reported as unavailable.');
        } catch (error) {
            return { service: 'Embedding Provider', status: 'unhealthy', details: (error as Error).message };
        }
    }
}
```

#### **2. Update `src/communication/messageRouter.ts`**

Expose the new health check service to the frontend.

```typescript
// src/communication/messageRouter.ts
// In the switch statement for message handling:

case 'runHealthChecks':
    const healthResults = await this.healthCheckService.runAllChecks();
    webview.postMessage({
        command: 'healthCheckResult',
        payload: healthResults
    });
    break;
```

#### **3. Update `webview-react/src/components/DiagnosticsView.tsx`**

Display the health check results in the UI.

```tsx
// webview-react/src/components/DiagnosticsView.tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Button, Spinner, Table, TableBody, TableRow, TableCell, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell } from '@fluentui/react-components';
import { postMessage, onMessageCommand } from '../utils/vscodeApi';

const DiagnosticsView: React.FC = () => {
    const [results, setResults] = useState<any[]>([]);
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

    const handleRunChecks = () => {
        setIsLoading(true);
        postMessage('runHealthChecks');
    };

    useEffect(() => {
        const unsubscribe = onMessageCommand('healthCheckResult', (data) => {
            setResults(data);
            setIsLoading(false);
        });
        return () => unsubscribe();
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <Button onClick={handleRunChecks} disabled={isLoading}>
                {isLoading ? <Spinner size="tiny" /> : 'Run Health Checks'}
            </Button>
            <Table>
                <TableHeader>
                    <TableRow>
                        <TableHeaderCell>Service</TableHeaderCell>
                        <TableHeaderCell>Status</TableHeaderCell>
                        <TableHeaderCell>Details</TableHeaderCell>
                    </TableRow>
                </TableHeader>
                <TableBody>
                    {results.map((result) => (
                        <TableRow key={result.service}>
                            <TableCell>{result.service}</TableCell>
                            <TableCell>{result.status}</TableCell>
                            <TableCell>{result.details}</TableCell>
                        </TableRow>
                    ))}
                </TableBody>
            </Table>
        </div>
    );
};
```

#### **4. Add Retry Logic to `src/indexing/indexingService.ts`**

Wrap the embedding generation, a network-sensitive operation, with `async-retry`.

```typescript
// src/indexing/indexingService.ts
import retry from 'async-retry';

// ... inside a method that calls the embedding provider ...

await retry(
    async (bail) => {
        // If the API returns a 4xx error, don't retry.
        try {
            vectors = await this.embeddingProvider.generateEmbeddings(chunkContents);
        } catch (error: any) {
            if (error.response && error.response.status >= 400 && error.response.status < 500) {
                bail(new Error('Unrecoverable embedding provider error.'));
                return;
            }
            throw error; // Triggers a retry
        }
    },
    {
        retries: 3,
        minTimeout: 1000, // 1 second
        factor: 2, // Double the timeout on each retry
        onRetry: (error, attempt) => {
            console.warn(`Embedding generation failed (attempt ${attempt}). Retrying...`);
        }
    }
);
```

## **Sprint 3: Security & UX**

**Objective:** To secure all indexed data at rest and improve the user experience by adding an inline search result preview.

-----

### **High-Level Plan**

1.  **Enable Qdrant Encryption:** Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to enable Qdrant's built-in encryption features.
2.  **Enhance the UI:** Update `QueryView.tsx` to include an expandable area for each search result.
3.  **Fetch Snippet:** When a result is expanded, send a message to the backend to fetch the full code snippet.
4.  **Display with Syntax Highlighting:** Use a library like `react-syntax-highlighter` to display the fetched snippet in the preview area.

### **External APIs & Packages**

  * **`react-syntax-highlighter`**: A popular React component for syntax highlighting code snippets using libraries like Prism or Highlight.js.
      * **Installation:** `npm install react-syntax-highlighter` and `npm install @types/react-syntax-highlighter`
      * [react-syntax-highlighter on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-syntax-highlighter)

### **Code Examples & Guidance**

#### **1. Update `docker-compose.yml` for Encryption**

Enable Qdrant's TLS encryption by providing self-signed certificates.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  qdrant:
    image: qdrant/qdrant:latest
    ports:
      - "6333:6333"
      - "6334:6334" # gRPC port
    volumes:
      - ./qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage
      # Mount certificates for TLS
      - ./certs:/qdrant/certs
    # Add environment variables to enable TLS
    environment:
      QDRANT__SERVICE__ENABLE_TLS: "true"
      QDRANT__TLS__CERT: "/qdrant/certs/cert.pem"
      QDRANT__TLS__KEY: "/qdrant/certs/key.pem"
```

*You will need to generate self-signed certificates and place them in a `certs` directory.*

#### **2. Add Preview to `webview-react/src/components/QueryView.tsx`**

Use a state variable to track the currently expanded result and fetch its content on demand.

```tsx
// webview-react/src/components/QueryView.tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Card, CardPreview, Button } from '@fluentui/react-components';
import SyntaxHighlighter from 'react-syntax-highlighter';
import { vs2015 } from 'react-syntax-highlighter/dist/esm/styles/hljs';
import { postMessage, onMessageCommand } from '../utils/vscodeApi';

const ResultCard = ({ result }) => {
    const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false);
    const [snippetContent, setSnippetContent] = useState('');

    const togglePreview = () => {
        if (!isExpanded && !snippetContent) {
            // Fetch snippet only on first expansion
            postMessage('getSnippetContent', { 
                filePath: result.payload.filePath, 
                startLine: result.payload.startLine,
                endLine: result.payload.endLine
            });
        }
        setIsExpanded(!isExpanded);
    };

    useEffect(() => {
        const unsubscribe = onMessageCommand('snippetContentResult', (data) => {
            if (data.filePath === result.payload.filePath) {
                setSnippetContent(data.content);
            }
        });
        return () => unsubscribe();
    }, [result.payload.filePath]);

    return (
        <Card>
            {/* ... CardHeader ... */}
            <Button onClick={togglePreview}>
                {isExpanded ? 'Hide Preview' : 'Show Preview'}
            </Button>
            {isExpanded && (
                <CardPreview>
                    {snippetContent ? (
                        <SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript" style={vs2015}>
                            {snippetContent}
                        </SyntaxHighlighter>
                    ) : (
                        <Spinner size="small" />
                    )}
                </CardPreview>
            )}
        </Card>
    );
};
```

#### **3. Add `getSnippetContent` Handler in `src/communication/messageRouter.ts`**

Create a new handler to read a specific range of lines from a file and send it back to the UI.

```typescript
// src/communication/messageRouter.ts
import * as fs from 'fs/promises';

// In the switch statement for message handling:

case 'getSnippetContent':
    try {
        const { filePath, startLine, endLine } = payload;
        const fileContent = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');
        const lines = fileContent.split('\n');
        const snippet = lines.slice(startLine - 1, endLine).join('\n');

        webview.postMessage({
            command: 'snippetContentResult',
            payload: { filePath, content: snippet }
        });
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle file read error
    }
    break;
```

## **Sprints 4-7: Implementation Guidance Summary**

Due to the extensive nature of the remaining sprints, here is a high-level summary of the implementation strategy. Detailed code examples will follow the same pattern as the sprints above.

### **Sprint 4: Monitoring & Configuration**

  * **`PerformanceService.ts`**: Create a new service that uses `performance.now()` to track the duration of key operations. Store metrics in memory.
  * **`DiagnosticsView.tsx`**: Add a new tab or section that calls a `getPerformanceMetrics` backend command. Use a library like `react-chartjs-2` to visualize the data.
  * **`SettingsView.tsx` (New File)**: Create a new React component that renders a form based on the settings defined in `package.json`. Use a `useEffect` hook to fetch the current settings on mount and a `postMessage` call to save them on change.

### **Sprint 5: Advanced Search & Multi-Repository Support**

  * **Multi-Repo `IndexingService`**: Refactor `startIndexing` to iterate over `vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders`. For each folder, generate a unique Qdrant collection name (e.g., hash of the folder path) and run the indexing process scoped to that folder and collection.
  * **Multi-Repo `SearchManager`**: The `performSemanticSearch` method must first determine the active workspace folder (using `vscode.workspace.getWorkspaceFolder(activeEditor.document.uri)`). It will then use the same logic as `IndexingService` to generate the correct collection name before querying Qdrant.
  * **`GitIntegrationService.ts`**: Create a new service that uses Node's `child_process.exec` to run `git blame` on a given file path and line number. Parse the output to extract the author and commit information. Expose this via a new `getGitBlame` message.

### **Sprint 6: Code Intelligence**

  * **`ASTService.ts`**: This service will use a library like `tree-sitter` to parse source code.
      * **Installation**: `npm install tree-sitter tree-sitter-typescript`
      * **Usage**: The service will have a method that takes code and a language, loads the appropriate `tree-sitter` grammar, and traverses the resulting Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to identify relationships (e.g., function calls).
  * **Code Relationship Mapper UI**: In the frontend, use a graph visualization library like `react-flow` or `vis-network` to render the dependency data returned by the `ASTService`.
  * **Multi-Language Support**: To add a language like Java, install its `tree-sitter` grammar (`npm install tree-sitter-java`) and create a `JavaFileParser.ts` that implements your existing parser interface, providing Java-specific logic for chunking code based on its AST.

### **Sprint 7: Developer Assistance**

  * **`RefactoringService.ts`**: This service will integrate with a static analysis tool or linter (e.g., ESLint's API for TypeScript). It will programmatically run the linter on a code snippet, identify rules that suggest refactoring, and format these as suggestions.
  * **Test Coverage Integration**:
      * **`TestCoverageService.ts`**: Create a service that can parse common test coverage report formats (e.g., `lcov.info`). Use a library like `lcov-parse`.
      * **UI Integration**: In `QueryView.tsx`, after receiving search results, send a message to the backend with the file paths. The `TestCoverageService` will look up the coverage for those files and return it. Decorate the `ResultCard` with an icon (e.g., green shield for covered, red for uncovered) based on the coverage status.

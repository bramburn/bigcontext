# Task List: Sprint 1 - Auto-Recovery & Health Monitoring

**Goal:** To implement automatic recovery mechanisms and comprehensive health monitoring for proactive webview issue detection and resolution.

| Task ID | Status | Task Description (Sequential & Atomic Steps) | File(s) To Modify |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1** | ☐ To Do | **Integrate `ConnectionMonitor`:** In `App.tsx`, import and initialize the `connectionMonitor` singleton, passing it the `vscodeApi` instance. | `webview-react/src/App.tsx` |
| **1.2** | ☐ To Do | **Implement Heartbeat Handler:** In `src/communication/messageRouter.ts`, add a handler for the `heartbeat` command that immediately posts back a `heartbeatResponse`. | `src/communication/messageRouter.ts` |
| **1.3** | ☐ To Do | **Implement Reconnection Logic:** In `shared/connectionMonitor.js`, implement the exponential backoff logic for reconnection attempts. | `shared/connectionMonitor.js` |
| **1.4** | ☐ To Do | **Create `ConnectionStatus.tsx` Component:** Create a new React component to display the connection status. It should subscribe to events from the `connectionMonitor`. | `webview-react/src/components/ConnectionStatus.tsx` (New) |
| **1.5** | ☐ To Do | **Add `ConnectionStatus` to UI:** Add the new `ConnectionStatus` component to the main `App.tsx` layout. | `webview-react/src/App.tsx` |
| **1.6** | ☐ To Do | **Implement Metrics Collection:** In `shared/connectionMonitor.js`, add logic to track metrics like latency and error counts. | `shared/connectionMonitor.js` |
| **1.7** | ☐ To Do | **Add `getHealthStatus` Handler:** In `src/communication/messageRouter.ts`, add a handler for the `getHealthStatus` command. | `src/communication/messageRouter.ts` |
| **1.8** | ☐ To Do | **Implement Frontend Handler:** The `connectionMonitor` should listen for `getHealthStatus` and respond with its collected metrics. | `shared/connectionMonitor.js` |
| **1.9** | ☐ To Do | **Implement Backend Logging:** The `MessageRouter` should log the received health status using the `CentralizedLoggingService`. | `src/communication/messageRouter.ts` |
| **1.10** | ☐ To Do | **Add Alerting Thresholds:** Add settings for health monitoring (e.g., `latencyThreshold`) to `package.json`. | `package.json` |
| **1.11** | ☐ To Do | **Implement Alerting Logic:** The backend should check metrics against the configured thresholds and use `NotificationService` to show warnings. | `src/extensionManager.ts` or a new `HealthManager` service |

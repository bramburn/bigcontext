# Backlog: Sub-Sprint 1 - Auto-Recovery System

**Objective:** To fully implement and integrate an automatic recovery system for webview communication failures, ensuring graceful handling of network interruptions.

**Parent Sprint:** PRD 1, Sprint 1: Auto-Recovery & Health Monitoring

### User Story: Automatic Connection Recovery

**As a** remote developer (Sarah),
**I want** the webview to automatically detect and recover from communication failures,
**So that** I don't lose functionality or context during temporary network interruptions.

**Actions to Undertake:**

1.  **Filepath**: `webview-react/src/App.tsx`
    *   **Action**: Import and initialize the `connectionMonitor` singleton, passing it the `vscodeApi` instance to enable communication.

2.  **Filepath**: `src/communication/messageRouter.ts`
    *   **Action**: Add a new message handler for the `heartbeat` command that immediately posts back a `heartbeatResponse` message to the webview.

3.  **Filepath**: `shared/connectionMonitor.js`
    *   **Action**: Implement the core heartbeat logic. The monitor should send a `heartbeat` message every 5 seconds and wait for a `heartbeatResponse`.
    *   **Action**: Implement an exponential backoff strategy for reconnection attempts if a `heartbeatResponse` is not received within a timeout period.

4.  **Filepath**: `webview-react/src/components/ConnectionStatus.tsx` (New File)
    *   **Action**: Create a new React component that subscribes to state change events from the `connectionMonitor` and displays the current connection status.

5.  **Filepath**: `webview-react/src/App.tsx`
    *   **Action**: Integrate the new `ConnectionStatus` component into the main application layout to make the connection status visible to the user.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The webview detects a lost connection within 10 seconds of the extension backend becoming unresponsive.
*   The UI clearly indicates "Connected", "Disconnected", and "Reconnecting..." states.
*   The system successfully recovers the connection after a temporary interruption without requiring a manual reload.

**Testing Plan:**

*   **Test Case 1**: Simulate a network disconnect. Verify the UI changes to "Reconnecting...".
*   **Test Case 2**: Restore the connection. Verify the UI changes back to "Connected" and that communication is re-established.

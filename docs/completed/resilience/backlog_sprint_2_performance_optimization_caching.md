# Backlog: Sprint 2 - Performance Optimization & Caching

**Objective:** To optimize webview performance through resource caching and to build a more resilient UI that can handle poor network conditions gracefully.

### User Story 1: Faster Webview Loading with Caching

**As a** performance-conscious developer (Mike),
**I want** optimized resource loading and local caching for the webview,
**So that** the extension feels fast and responsive, especially on subsequent loads or with slow connections.

**Actions to Undertake:**

1.  **Filepath**: `webview-react/vite.config.ts`
    *   **Action**: Configure Vite's build process for code splitting to create smaller, more manageable JavaScript chunks.
    *   **Implementation**: Use `build.rollupOptions.output` to define chunking strategy.

2.  **Filepath**: `webview-react/public/sw.js` (New File)
    *   **Action**: Create a new service worker file.
    *   **Implementation**: Implement caching strategies (e.g., cache-first for static assets) for JS, CSS, and other assets.

3.  **Filepath**: `webview-react/src/main.tsx`
    *   **Action**: Add logic to register the service worker (`sw.js`) when the application starts.

4.  **Filepath**: `webview-react/public/sw.js`
    *   **Action**: Implement a cache-busting mechanism. The service worker should check for a new version of the extension on activation and invalidate the old cache to prevent serving stale content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The Vite build is configured for optimal code splitting.
*   A service worker is implemented in the React webview to cache static assets locally.
*   Subsequent loads of the webview are significantly faster due to assets being served from the local cache.
*   A cache-busting strategy is in place to ensure users receive updates correctly.

**Testing Plan:**

*   **Test Case 1**: Load the webview for the first time and measure load time using browser dev tools.
*   **Test Case 2**: Reload the webview and verify that static assets (JS, CSS) are served from the service worker cache.
*   **Test Case 3**: Measure the load time on the second load and confirm it is significantly faster.
*   **Test Case 4**: After making a change to the webview code and rebuilding, verify that the new version is loaded and the cache is updated.

### User Story 2: Graceful Degradation in Poor Network Conditions

**As a** remote developer (Sarah),
**I want** the application to provide graceful degradation when network conditions are poor,
**So that** I can continue working with reduced functionality rather than experiencing a complete failure.

**Actions to Undertake:**

1.  **Filepath**: `shared/connectionMonitor.js`
    *   **Action**: Enhance the `ConnectionMonitor` to detect poor network conditions. This can be based on high latency or by using the `navigator.connection` API if available.
    *   **Action**: Based on the detected bandwidth, the monitor should emit a `qualityChange` event (e.g., 'poor', 'good').

2.  **Filepath**: `webview-react/src/App.tsx`
    *   **Action**: Subscribe to the `qualityChange` event and store the quality state. Pass this state down to relevant components.
    *   **Implementation**: Components can use this state to disable expensive features like animations or high-frequency updates.

3.  **Filepath**: `shared/connectionMonitor.js`
    *   **Action**: Implement an offline queue for user actions. When the status is 'disconnected', outgoing messages should be stored in a queue.
    *   **Action**: When the connection is re-established (`handleReconnect`), send all queued messages to the backend.

4.  **Filepath**: `webview-react/src/components/ConnectionStatus.tsx`
    *   **Action**: Enhance the UI to clearly notify the user when the application is in a "degraded" or "offline" mode, explaining the impact.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The `ConnectionMonitor` detects bandwidth and adjusts UI behavior accordingly (e.g., disabling non-essential features).
*   User actions are queued when the webview is offline and sent automatically upon reconnection.
*   The UI clearly notifies the user when it is in a "degraded" or "offline" mode.

**Testing Plan:**

*   **Test Case 1**: Use browser dev tools to throttle the network to a slow speed. Verify that the UI enters a "degraded" state.
*   **Test Case 2**: Disconnect the network. Perform an action that sends a message. Verify the action is queued.
*   **Test Case 3**: Reconnect the network. Verify the queued message is sent and processed by the backend.

# Backlog: Sprint 1 - Auto-Recovery & Health Monitoring

**Objective:** To implement a resilient webview that can automatically recover from transient communication failures and provide comprehensive health monitoring for proactive issue detection.

---

### User Story 1: Automatic Connection Recovery

**As a** remote developer (Sarah),
**I want** the webview to automatically detect and recover from communication failures,
**So that** I don't lose functionality or context during temporary network interruptions.

**Actions to Undertake:**

1.  **Filepath**: `webview-react/src/App.tsx`
    *   **Action**: Import and initialize the `connectionMonitor` singleton, passing it the `vscodeApi` instance to enable communication.

2.  **Filepath**: `src/communication/messageRouter.ts`
    *   **Action**: Add a new message handler for the `heartbeat` command that immediately posts back a `heartbeatResponse` message to the webview.

3.  **Filepath**: `shared/connectionMonitor.js`
    *   **Action**: Implement the core heartbeat logic. The monitor should send a `heartbeat` message every 5 seconds and wait for a `heartbeatResponse`.
    *   **Action**: Implement an exponential backoff strategy for reconnection attempts if a `heartbeatResponse` is not received within a timeout period.

4.  **Filepath**: `webview-react/src/components/ConnectionStatus.tsx` (New File)
    *   **Action**: Create a new React component that subscribes to state change events from the `connectionMonitor`.

5.  **Filepath**: `webview-react/src/App.tsx`
    *   **Action**: Integrate the new `ConnectionStatus` component into the main application layout to make the connection status visible to the user.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The `ConnectionMonitor` implements a heartbeat mechanism to detect lost connections.
*   When a connection is lost, it automatically attempts to reconnect using an exponential backoff strategy.
*   The UI displays a clear, non-intrusive indicator of the connection status (e.g., "Connected", "Reconnecting...", "Disconnected").
*   The webview successfully recovers the connection after a temporary interruption without requiring a manual reload.

**Testing Plan:**

*   **Test Case 1**: Simulate a network disconnect. Verify the UI changes to "Reconnecting...".
*   **Test Case 2**: Restore the connection. Verify the UI changes back to "Connected" and that communication is re-established.
*   **Test Case 3**: Manually stop the extension backend while the webview is open. Verify the disconnect is detected and reconnection attempts begin.

### User Story 2: Webview Health Monitoring

**As an** extension developer,
**I want** comprehensive health monitoring that tracks webview performance and errors,
**So that** issues can be identified, diagnosed, and resolved proactively.

**Actions to Undertake:**

1.  **Filepath**: `shared/connectionMonitor.js`
    *   **Action**: Add logic to collect key performance metrics, such as message latency (calculated from the heartbeat roundtrip), total reconnection attempts, and error counts.

2.  **Filepath**: `src/communication/messageRouter.ts`
    *   **Action**: Add a new message handler for a `getHealthStatus` command, which will be sent from the extension backend.

3.  **Filepath**: `shared/connectionMonitor.js`
    *   **Action**: Implement a listener for the `getHealthStatus` message. When received, it should gather the latest metrics and post them back in a `healthStatusResponse` message.

4.  **Filepath**: `src/communication/messageRouter.ts`
    *   **Action**: Upon receiving the `healthStatusResponse`, log the metrics using the `CentralizedLoggingService`.

5.  **Filepath**: `package.json`
    *   **Action**: Add new configuration settings for health monitoring thresholds (e.g., `code-context-engine.health.latencyThreshold`).

6.  **Filepath**: `src/extensionManager.ts` (or a new `HealthManager` service)
    *   **Action**: Implement logic to periodically request the health status, check the received metrics against the configured thresholds, and use the `NotificationService` to show a VS Code warning if a threshold is breached.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The extension backend can successfully request and receive a health status report from the webview.
*   Metrics like latency, error counts, and reconnection attempts are correctly logged.
*   A configurable alerting threshold is in place for critical metrics (e.g., high latency).
*   A VS Code warning notification is displayed if the webview's message latency exceeds the configured threshold.

**Testing Plan:**

*   **Test Case 1**: Trigger the `getHealthStatus` command from the backend. Verify the health metrics are received and logged correctly.
*   **Test Case 2**: Set a low `latencyThreshold` in the settings. Simulate high latency. Verify that a warning notification is displayed.

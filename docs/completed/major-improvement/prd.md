<prd>Of course. I've analyzed the extensive list of user stories and have grouped them into three logical, sequential themes. This approach will allow us to incrementally deliver high-value features, starting with the most impactful user experience improvements.

Here is the first set of PRDs for the **Core UX Enhancements**.

-----

### **New Document: PRD 1: Foundational - Core UX Enhancements**

**1. Title & Overview**

  * **Project:** Code Context Engine - Core UX Enhancements
  * **Summary:** This phase focuses on significantly improving the day-to-day user experience of the extension. We will introduce a persistent status bar indicator for at-a-glance feedback, create an interactive and human-friendly search results view, and add advanced features like result pagination and an enhanced search history.
  * **Dependencies:** Requires the existing SvelteKit frontend and the backend search API (`ContextService`) to be functional.

-----

**2. Goals & Success Metrics**

  * **Business Objectives:**
      * Increase daily user engagement by making the extension more intuitive and informative.
      * Reduce the time it takes for a user to find and act upon a search result.
  * **User Success Metrics:**
      * 75% of users interact with the rich search results (e.g., clicking to open a file) instead of just copying text.
      * User session duration increases by 20% due to the improved usability of the search history and pagination.
      * The status bar indicator is cited as a helpful feature in user feedback.

-----

**3. User Personas**

  * **Devin (Developer - End User):** Devin wants the extension to feel like a natural part of VS Code. He needs clear, immediate feedback on the system's status and wants his search results to be easy to navigate and act upon without cumbersome copy-pasting.
  * **Frank (Frontend Developer):** Frank is responsible for implementing the UI. He needs clear specifications for the new interactive components, state management logic for features like toggling views, and a plan for handling lists of data with pagination.

-----

**4. Requirements Breakdown**

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: UX** | **Sprint 1: Status Bar & Guided Tour** | As Devin, I want to see the current status of the Code Context Engine in the VS Code status bar, so that I know if it's ready, indexing, or has an error without having to open the sidebar panel. | 1. A new status bar item is added to the VS Code UI.\<br/\>2. The item displays an icon and text representing the current state (e.g., `$(zap) Ready`, `$(sync~spin) Indexing`, `$(error) Error`).\<br/\>3. Clicking the status bar item opens the main webview panel. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As a first-time user, I want a brief, interactive tour of the UI after my first successful index, so that I can quickly learn how to use the core features. | 1. After the first indexing completes, a guided tour overlay is shown.\<br/\>2. The tour highlights the query input box, the results area, and the settings icon.\<br/\>3. The user can easily dismiss the tour or step through it. | |
| **Phase 1: UX** | **Sprint 2: Interactive Search Results** | As a user, I want the search results to be interactive cards, so that I can explore my code directly from the UI. | 1. Each search result is displayed as a distinct card.\<br/\>2. The card contains a code snippet with syntax highlighting.\<br/\>3. Clicking the file path on the card opens the file in a new editor tab at the correct line.\<br/\>4. Each card has a "Copy Snippet" button that copies the code to the clipboard. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As a power user, I want to be able to switch between a user-friendly view of the results and the raw `repomix`-style XML output, so that I can use the best format for my current task. | 1. A toggle switch (e.g., "UI" / "XML") is added to the results view.\<br/\>2. The default view is the user-friendly card layout.\<br/\>3. Toggling to "XML" displays the raw XML output from the backend in a `<pre>` block.\<br/\>4. The user's preference is remembered for the duration of the session. | |
| **Phase 1: UX** | **Sprint 3: Search History & Pagination** | As a user, I want to see my search history with more context, so that I can easily re-run previous queries. | 1. The search history is displayed when the query input is empty.\<br/\>2. Each history item shows the query string, the number of results found, and a timestamp.\<br/\>3. Clicking a history item re-runs that query.\<br/\>4. Search history is persisted across sessions. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As a user, I want the results to be paginated if there are too many, so that the UI remains fast and I'm not overwhelmed. | 1. If a query returns more than a set number of results (e.g., 20), only the first page is displayed.\<br/\>2. A "Load More" button is shown at the end of the results list.\<br/\>3. Clicking "Load More" fetches and appends the next page of results to the list.\<br/\>4. The button is hidden when all results have been loaded. | |

-----

**5. Timeline & Sprints**

  * **Total Estimated Time:** 6 Weeks
  * **Sprint 1:** Status Bar & Guided Tour (2 Weeks)
  * **Sprint 2:** Interactive Search Results (2 Weeks)
  * **Sprint 3:** Search History & Pagination (2 Weeks)

-----

**6. Risks & Assumptions**

  * **Risk:** The logic for incremental updates to the status bar could be complex, especially with multiple asynchronous operations running.
      * **Mitigation:** Rely on the `StateManager` as the single source of truth. The status bar component should simply subscribe to state changes and update its display accordingly.
  * **Risk:** Implementing client-side syntax highlighting for code snippets could impact UI performance.
      * **Mitigation:** Use a lightweight and fast syntax highlighting library (e.g., `highlight.js` or `prism.js`) and ensure it runs efficiently within the Svelte component lifecycle.
  * **Assumption:** The backend API can be modified to support pagination for search results (e.g., by accepting `page` and `pageSize` parameters).

-----

### **New Document: Sub-Sprint 1: Status Bar Indicator**

**Objective:**
To implement a persistent status bar item that provides users with at-a-glance feedback on the extension's state.

**Parent Sprint:**
PRD 1, Sprint 1: Status Bar & Guided Tour

**Tasks:**

1.  **Create `StatusBarManager.ts`:** Develop a new manager class responsible for creating and updating the VS Code status bar item.
2.  **Subscribe to `StateManager`:** The `StatusBarManager` will subscribe to events from the `StateManager` to know when to update.
3.  **Implement State Logic:** Update the status bar's text, icon, tooltip, and command based on the current state (e.g., `Ready`, `Indexing`, `Error`).
4.  **Integrate into `ExtensionManager`:** Instantiate the `StatusBarManager` during the extension's activation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  * A status bar item appears in the bottom-left of the VS Code window.
  * The icon and text change correctly when the extension's state changes.
  * Clicking the status bar item opens the main extension panel.

**Dependencies:**

  * A functional `StateManager` must be in place.

**Timeline:**

  * **Start Date:** 2025-08-27
  * **End Date:** 2025-09-02

-----

### **New Document: Sub-Sprint 2: Guided Tour**

**Objective:**
To create a simple, dismissible guided tour for users who have completed their first indexing run.

**Parent Sprint:**
PRD 1, Sprint 1: Status Bar & Guided Tour

**Tasks:**

1.  **Create `GuidedTour.svelte` component:** Build a Svelte component that can display an overlay with highlighted sections and descriptive text.
2.  **Implement Tour State:** The tour will have multiple steps, managed by local component state.
3.  **Trigger Tour:** The `IndexingView.svelte` component, upon receiving the "indexing complete" event for the first time, will trigger the tour.
4.  **Persist Tour Completion:** After the user completes or dismisses the tour, set a flag in `vscode.ExtensionContext.globalState` to ensure it doesn't appear again.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  * The tour appears automatically after the very first successful indexing.
  * The tour correctly highlights the key UI elements.
  * The tour does not appear on subsequent indexing runs.

**Dependencies:**

  * The `IndexingView.svelte` component must be able to signal completion.

**Timeline:**

  * **Start Date:** 2025-09-03
  * **End Date:** 2025-09-09

-----

### **New Document: tasklist\_sprint\_01.md**

# Task List: Sprint 1 - Status Bar & Guided Tour

**Goal:** To implement the status bar indicator and the first-run guided tour.

| Task ID | Status | Task Description (Sequential & Atomic Steps) | File(s) To Modify |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1** | ☐ To Do | **Create `StatusBarManager.ts`:** Create the new file and class. Implement a method to create the `vscode.StatusBarItem`. | `src/statusBarManager.ts` (New) |
| **1.2** | ☐ To Do | **Implement `updateStatus` method:** In `StatusBarManager`, create a method that takes the extension state and updates the `text`, `tooltip`, and `command` of the status bar item. | `src/statusBarManager.ts` |
| **1.3** | ☐ To Do | **Integrate with `StateManager`:** In `ExtensionManager`, instantiate `StatusBarManager` and have it subscribe to state changes from `StateManager`. | `src/extensionManager.ts` |
| **1.4** | ☐ To Do | **Create `GuidedTour.svelte`:** Build the Svelte component with slots for content and logic to control visibility and steps. | `webview/src/lib/components/GuidedTour.svelte` (New) |
| **1.5** | ☐ To Do | **Implement First-Run Check:** In the main Svelte view, use `vscodeApi` to check a global state flag on mount to determine if the tour should be shown. | `webview/src/routes/+page.svelte` |
| **1.6** | ☐ To Do | **Trigger Tour on Index Completion:** When the `indexingCompleted` message is received, and the first-run flag is not set, activate the guided tour. | `webview/src/lib/components/IndexingView.svelte` |
| **1.7** | ☐ To Do | **Persist Tour Dismissal:** When the tour is finished, send a message to the extension backend to set the global state flag `hasCompletedFirstRun` to true. | `src/messageRouter.ts` |

Of course. Here is the next PRD in our plan, which focuses on enhancing the core indexing engine to be more automated and manageable.

-----

### **New Document: PRD 2: Foundational - Indexing Engine Enhancements**

**1. Title & Overview**

  * **Project:** Code Context Engine - Indexing Engine Enhancements
  * **Summary:** This phase focuses on evolving the indexing process from a manual, one-time operation into a dynamic, automated system. We will implement a file watcher to enable automatic, incremental updates to the index as code changes. We will also add critical management features, allowing users to pause, resume, and clear their index, providing more control and better resource management.
  * **Dependencies:** Requires a functional manual indexing process and the Diagnostics View UI from the previous PRDs.

-----

**2. Goals & Success Metrics**

  * **Business Objectives:**
      * Significantly increase the long-term value and "stickiness" of the extension by ensuring search results are always current.
      * Improve user trust and control by making the indexing process transparent and manageable.
  * **User Success Metrics:**
      * 90% of file changes (saves) are reflected in the index within 10 seconds of the change.
      * The "pause" and "resume" functionality for indexing is used by at least 20% of users with large repositories (a sign that it's a valued resource management feature).
      * The index health and management features in the Diagnostics panel are used to successfully resolve at least 50% of user-reported indexing issues without needing further support.

-----

**3. User Personas**

  * **Devin (Developer - End User):** Devin works in a fast-paced environment and expects his tools to keep up. He doesn't want to remember to re-index his project every time he makes a change. He needs the search results to be consistently accurate and up-to-date. During a large refactor, he also wants to be able to pause indexing to maximize his machine's performance for compilation tasks.
  * **Alisha (Backend Developer):** Alisha is responsible for the stability of the indexing pipeline. She needs to implement a robust file-watching system that is efficient and doesn't consume excessive resources. She also needs to add state management and persistence to handle pausing and resuming complex, multi-stage indexing jobs.

-----

**4. Requirements Breakdown**

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 2: Indexing** | **Sprint 4: Automatic & Incremental Indexing** | As a developer, I want the extension to automatically detect when I save changes to a file and update the index in the background, so that my search results are always up-to-date. | 1. The extension uses `vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher` to monitor file changes (`.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, etc.).\<br/\>2. On file save, the specific file is re-parsed and its corresponding vectors are updated in the Qdrant database.\<br/\>3. On file deletion, the corresponding vectors are removed from the database.\<br/\>4. On file creation, the new file is parsed and its vectors are added to the database. | **2 Weeks** |
| **Phase 2: Indexing** | **Sprint 5: Index Management & Control** | As a developer, I want to be able to pause and resume a long-running indexing process, so that I can free up system resources for a CPU-intensive task without losing my progress. | 1. The `IndexingView.svelte` component has "Pause" and "Resume" buttons that are visible during indexing.\<br/\>2. Clicking "Pause" gracefully stops the indexing pipeline and persists its current state (e.g., list of remaining files).\<br/\>3. The `StateManager` reflects the "paused" state.\<br/\>4. Clicking "Resume" successfully continues the indexing process from where it left off. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As a developer, I want to see the status and size of my current index and have the option to clear it, so that I can manage my disk space and troubleshoot issues. | 1. The `DiagnosticsView.svelte` panel is updated to display the total number of indexed files and vectors.\<br/\>2. A "Clear Index" button is added to the Diagnostics panel.\<br/\>3. Clicking the button completely removes the Qdrant collection for the current workspace and resets the local configuration state. | |

-----

**5. Timeline & Sprints**

  * **Total Estimated Time:** 4 Weeks
  * **Sprint 4:** Automatic & Incremental Indexing (2 Weeks)
  * **Sprint 5:** Index Management & Control (2 Weeks)

-----

**6. Risks & Assumptions**

  * **Risk:** A naive file watcher implementation could trigger too many indexing jobs in rapid succession (e.g., during a branch switch with many file changes), leading to high CPU usage.
      * **Mitigation:** Implement a debouncing mechanism for the file watcher's event handler. This will batch multiple file changes that occur in a short period into a single, efficient update operation.
  * **Risk:** Persisting the state of a complex, multi-threaded indexing process for pause/resume functionality can be highly complex and prone to bugs.
      * **Mitigation:** Start with a simple implementation. The initial version of "pause" could simply stop the process after the *current file* is finished, saving the queue of remaining files. More granular, mid-file pause states can be a future enhancement.
  * **Assumption:** The Qdrant database API provides an efficient way to delete specific vectors by their ID/metadata, which is necessary for handling file changes and deletions.

-----

### **New Document: Sub-Sprint 5: File System Watcher for Auto-Indexing**

**Objective:**
To implement the core file system watcher that will trigger automatic, incremental index updates.

**Parent Sprint:**
PRD 2, Sprint 4: Automatic & Incremental Indexing

**Tasks:**

1.  **Create `FileSystemWatcherManager.ts`:** Develop a new manager class responsible for creating and managing the `vscode.FileSystemWatcher`.
2.  **Implement Debouncing:** The manager's event handler for file changes must be debounced to prevent excessive updates.
3.  **Handle `onDidChange`, `onDidCreate`, `onDidDelete`:** Implement logic to handle each type of file event.
4.  **Update `IndexingService`:** Add new methods to the `IndexingService` for handling single-file updates (e.g., `updateFileInIndex`, `removeFileFromIndex`).
5.  **Integrate with `ExtensionManager`:** Instantiate the `FileSystemWatcherManager` during extension activation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  * Saving a tracked file triggers the `onDidChange` handler after a short debounce period.
  * The `IndexingService` is correctly called to update the single file.
  * Deleting a tracked file triggers the `onDidDelete` handler.

**Dependencies:**

  * A functional `IndexingService` with methods for incremental updates.

**Timeline:**

  * **Start Date:** 2025-09-10
  * **End Date:** 2025-09-16

-----

### **New Document: Sub-Sprint 6: Pause, Resume, and Index Management UI**

**Objective:**
To build the UI components and backend logic for managing and controlling the indexing process.

**Parent Sprint:**
PRD 2, Sprint 5: Index Management & Control

**Tasks:**

1.  **Add Pause/Resume Buttons:** Add "Pause" and "Resume" buttons to the `IndexingView.svelte` component. Their visibility should be controlled by the `isIndexing` state.
2.  **Update `StateManager`:** Add a new "paused" state to the `StateManager` to differentiate between running, paused, and idle states.
3.  **Implement Pause/Resume in `IndexingService`:** Add `pause()` and `resume()` methods to the `IndexingService`. The `pause()` method will set a flag that the indexing loop checks, and it will save the queue of remaining files. `resume()` will restart the loop with the saved queue.
4.  **Update Diagnostics View:** In `DiagnosticsView.svelte`, add a section to display index statistics (e.g., total vectors).
5.  **Implement "Clear Index" Logic:** Add a "Clear Index" button to the `DiagnosticsView` that sends a message to the backend. The backend handler will call a new method in the `QdrantService` to delete the collection for the current workspace.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  * The "Pause" button successfully stops the indexing process, and the state is updated.
  * The "Resume" button successfully continues indexing from where it left off.
  * The "Clear Index" button removes all indexed data for the current workspace.

**Dependencies:**

  * A functional `StateManager` and `IndexingView.svelte` component.

**Timeline:**

  * **Start Date:** 2025-09-17
  * **End Date:** 2025-09-23

### **New Document: tasklist\_sprint\_05.md**

# Task List: Sprint 5 - Index Management & Control

**Goal:** To give users control over the indexing process with pause/resume functionality and index management tools.

| Task ID | Status | Task Description (Sequential & Atomic Steps) | File(s) To Modify |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5.1** | ☐ To Do | **Add `isPaused` to `StateManager`:** Add a new boolean state to `StateManager` to track the paused status. | `src/stateManager.ts` |
| **5.2** | ☐ To Do | **Add Pause/Resume Buttons to UI:** In `IndexingView.svelte`, add "Pause" and "Resume" buttons. Use an `{#if}` block to show them only when `isIndexing` is true. | `webview/src/lib/components/IndexingView.svelte` |
| **5.3** | ☐ To Do | **Implement `pause` method:** In `IndexingService`, create a `pause()` method that sets `stateManager.isPaused = true` and saves the list of remaining files to be processed. | `src/indexing/indexingService.ts` |
| **5.4** | ☐ To Do | **Implement `resume` method:** In `IndexingService`, create a `resume()` method that sets `stateManager.isPaused = false` and continues the indexing loop using the saved list of remaining files. | `src/indexing/indexingService.ts` |
| **5.5** | ☐ To Do | **Connect UI to Pause/Resume:** Wire the Svelte buttons to send `pauseIndexing` and `resumeIndexing` messages to the `MessageRouter`, which then calls the `IndexingService`. | `webview/src/lib/components/IndexingView.svelte`, `src/messageRouter.ts` |
| **5.6** | ☐ To Do | **Add Index Stats to Diagnostics UI:** In `DiagnosticsView.svelte`, add a section to display the total number of vectors, fetched from a new `getCollectionInfo` method in `ContextService`. | `webview/src/lib/components/DiagnosticsView.svelte` |
| **5.7** | ☐ To Do | **Add "Clear Index" Button:** Add a "Clear Index" button to the `DiagnosticsView.svelte` component. | `webview/src/lib/components/DiagnosticsView.svelte` |

Of course. Here is the final PRD, which addresses advanced configuration and support for complex development environments.

-----

### **New Document: PRD 3: Foundational - Advanced Configuration & Multi-Workspace Support**

**1. Title & Overview**

  * **Project:** Code Context Engine - Advanced Configuration & Multi-Workspace
  * **Summary:** This final phase focuses on delivering power-user features that provide granular control over the extension's performance and behavior in complex environments. We will implement resource management settings to control indexing intensity and introduce a robust architecture to correctly manage separate indexes for different projects within a multi-workspace setup.
  * **Dependencies:** Requires a functional indexing pipeline and the native VS Code settings UI integration.

-----

**2. Goals & Success Metrics**

  * **Business Objectives:**
      * Cater to professional developers and teams working in complex, multi-repository environments.
      * Improve the extension's performance and resource-friendliness, making it a better "citizen" on a developer's machine.
  * **User Success Metrics:**
      * The "Low" indexing intensity setting reduces average CPU consumption during indexing by at least 30%.
      * When multiple workspace folders are open, search results from a query in one folder do not include results from other, unrelated folders.
      * The extension correctly maintains and queries separate Qdrant collections for each distinct workspace folder.

-----

**3. User Personas**

  * **Devin (Developer - End User):** Devin often has multiple microservice repositories open in a single VS Code workspace. He needs the context engine to be "smart" enough to know which repository he's currently working in and provide relevant search results only from that specific project. He also wants to be able to turn down the indexing speed when he's on battery power or running other intensive tasks.
  * **Alisha (Backend Developer):** Alisha needs to implement the architectural changes to support multiple workspaces. This involves refactoring how the extension identifies the current context, manages multiple database collections, and routes queries to the correct index.

-----

**4. Requirements Breakdown**

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 3: Advanced** | **Sprint 6: Resource Management** | As a developer, I want to be able to control the resource consumption of the extension, so that it doesn't slow down my machine. | 1. A new setting, `code-context-engine.indexingIntensity`, is added to the native VS Code settings UI (`package.json`).\<br/\>2. The setting is an enum with options: "Low", "Medium", "High".\<br/\>3. The `IndexingService` reads this setting and adjusts its behavior (e.g., adds delays between file processing on "Low", uses fewer parallel workers). | **2 Weeks** |
| **Phase 3: Advanced** | **Sprint 7: Multi-Workspace Support** | As a developer who works with multiple projects at once, I want the extension to manage a separate index for each of my workspaces, so that search results are always relevant to the project I'm currently focused on. | 1. The extension generates a unique Qdrant collection name for each folder in a VS Code workspace.\<br/\>2. The `IndexingService` correctly indexes each folder into its own separate collection.\<br/\>3. When a query is made, the `ContextService` identifies the active file's workspace folder.\<br/\>4. The query is routed to search only the specific Qdrant collection associated with that folder. | **2 Weeks** |

-----

**5. Timeline & Sprints**

  * **Total Estimated Time:** 4 Weeks
  * **Sprint 6:** Resource Management (2 Weeks)
  * **Sprint 7:** Multi-Workspace Support (2 Weeks)

-----

**6. Risks & Assumptions**

  * **Risk:** The logic to map files to their corresponding workspace folder and Qdrant collection could be complex in nested or overlapping folder structures.
      * **Mitigation:** Rely on the VS Code API `vscode.workspace.getWorkspaceFolder(uri)` which is designed to solve this exact problem. It reliably finds the correct parent workspace folder for any given file URI.
  * **Risk:** Managing multiple indexing processes (one for each workspace) could be resource-intensive.
      * **Mitigation:** Implement a queueing system. The `IndexingService` should only index one workspace folder at a time, even if multiple are added simultaneously. The "Indexing Intensity" setting will also help manage this.
  * **Assumption:** Users with multiple workspace folders want their searches to be scoped to the current folder by default.

-----

### **New Document: Sub-Sprint 7: Indexing Intensity Controls**

**Objective:**
To implement the "Indexing Intensity" setting, allowing users to control the resource consumption of the indexing process.

**Parent Sprint:**
PRD 3, Sprint 6: Resource Management

**Tasks:**

1.  **Add Setting to `package.json`:** Define the `code-context-engine.indexingIntensity` setting with `enum` options "Low", "Medium", "High".
2.  **Read Setting in `ConfigService`:** Add a new getter method in `ConfigService` to retrieve the current intensity level.
3.  **Implement Throttling in `IndexingService`:** In the main file processing loop of the `IndexingService`, read the intensity setting.
4.  **Apply Delays:** If the setting is "Low" or "Medium", add a small `await delay(...)` inside the loop to yield CPU time to other processes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  * The new setting appears in the native VS Code settings UI.
  * Setting the intensity to "Low" visibly slows down the indexing process and results in lower average CPU usage.
  * The "High" setting runs the indexing process as fast as possible (current behavior).

**Dependencies:**

  * A functional `IndexingService` and `ConfigService`.

**Timeline:**

  * **Start Date:** 2025-09-24
  * **End Date:** 2025-09-30

-----

### **New Document: Sub-Sprint 8: Per-Folder Indexing**

**Objective:**
To refactor the indexing and query services to support managing a separate index for each folder in a VS Code multi-root workspace.

**Parent Sprint:**
PRD 3, Sprint 7: Multi-Workspace Support

**Tasks:**

1.  **Update Collection Naming:** Modify the `generateCollectionName` logic to take a `vscode.WorkspaceFolder` as an argument and generate a unique, deterministic name based on its path.
2.  **Refactor `IndexingService`:** The main `startIndexing` command should now iterate over all `vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders` and trigger a separate, queued indexing job for each.
3.  **Refactor `ContextService`:** The `queryContext` method must now first determine which workspace the active file or query belongs to.
4.  **Use `vscode.workspace.getWorkspaceFolder`:** Use this VS Code API method to reliably find the correct workspace folder for the current context.
5.  **Route Query to Correct Collection:** Pass the unique collection name for the identified workspace to the `QdrantService` so the search is correctly scoped.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  * Opening a workspace with two folders results in two distinct collections being created in Qdrant.
  * Querying from a file in `folderA` only returns results from `folderA`.
  * Querying from a file in `folderB` only returns results from `folderB`.

**Dependencies:**

  * A functional end-to-end indexing and querying pipeline.

**Timeline:**

  * **Start Date:** 2025-10-01
  * **End Date:** 2025-10-07

# Task List: Sprint 6 - Resource Management

**Goal:** To implement the "Indexing Intensity" setting to give users control over CPU consumption.

| Task ID | Status | Task Description (Sequential & Atomic Steps) | File(s) To Modify |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **6.1** | ☐ To Do | **Define `indexingIntensity` Setting:** In `package.json`, add the new `code-context-engine.indexingIntensity` property to `contributes.configuration`. Set the type to `string`, default to `High`, and provide an `enum` of `["High", "Medium", "Low"]`. | `package.json` |
| **6.2** | ☐ To Do | **Add Getter to `ConfigService`:** In `src/configService.ts`, add a new method `getIndexingIntensity()` that returns the configured value. | `src/configService.ts` |
| **6.3** | ☐ To Do | **Create Delay Helper:** Create a simple async delay function, e.g., `const delay = (ms) => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, ms));`. | `src/indexing/indexingService.ts` |
| **6.4** | ☐ To Do | **Read Intensity in `IndexingService`:** At the start of the `startIndexing` method, get the intensity level from the `ConfigService`. | `src/indexing/indexingService.ts` |
| **6.5** | ☐ To Do | **Implement Throttling Logic:** Inside the main `for` loop that processes files, add a `switch` statement based on the intensity level. Call `await delay(X)` where X is a small number for "Medium" (e.g., 50ms) and a larger number for "Low" (e.g., 200ms). | `src/indexing/indexingService.ts` |
| **6.6** | ☐ To Do | **Test Low Intensity:** Set the setting to "Low", start indexing a medium-sized project, and monitor system CPU usage. Verify it is noticeably lower than on "High". | `(Manual Test)` |
| **6.7** | ☐ To Do | **Test High Intensity:** Set the setting to "High" and verify the indexing runs at maximum speed with no artificial delays. | `(Manual Test)` |

# Task List: Sprint 7 - Multi-Workspace Support

**Goal:** To correctly handle multi-root workspaces by creating a separate index for each folder.

| Task ID | Status | Task Description (Sequential & Atomic Steps) | File(s) To Modify |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **7.1** | ☐ To Do | **Update `generateCollectionName`:** Modify this method in `IndexingService` (or a shared utility) to accept a `vscode.WorkspaceFolder` and return a name derived from its path (e.g., hashing the `folder.uri.fsPath`). | `src/indexing/indexingService.ts` |
| **7.2** | ☐ To Do | **Refactor `startIndexing` Command:** The command handler should now get the list of all workspace folders via `vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders`. | `src/commandManager.ts` |
| **7.3** | ☐ To Do | **Loop Over Workspaces:** The handler should loop through each folder and call a refactored `indexingService.indexWorkspace(folder)` method for each. | `src/commandManager.ts` |
| **7.4** | ☐ To Do | **Refactor `ContextService` Query Method:** The `queryContext` method must be updated to accept a file URI as context. | `src/context/contextService.ts` |
| **7.5** | ☐ To Do | **Identify Active Workspace:** In `queryContext`, use `vscode.workspace.getWorkspaceFolder(fileUri)` to find the correct `WorkspaceFolder` for the query context. | `src/context/contextService.ts` |
| **7.6** | ☐ To Do | **Calculate Collection Name for Query:** Use the `generateCollectionName` method to get the correct collection name for the identified workspace folder. | `src/context/contextService.ts` |
| **7.7** | ☐ To Do | **Pass Collection Name to Search:** Pass the correctly scoped collection name to the `qdrantService.search` method. | `src/context/contextService.ts` |
| **7.8** | ☐ To Do | **Test Multi-Workspace Indexing:** Create a new VS Code workspace with two separate project folders. Run the index command and verify (via logs or Qdrant UI) that two distinct collections are created. | `(Manual Test)` |
| **7.9** | ☐ To Do | **Test Scoped Search:** Open a file in the first folder and run a query. Verify results are only from that folder. Repeat for a file in the second folder and verify the results are correctly scoped. | `(Manual Test)` |

This completes the full set of planned PRDs for the new features and enhancements. You now have a comprehensive roadmap to guide the development of these advanced capabilities.

```
<prompt>
  <purpose>
    You are an expert AI Project Manager and Senior Software Architect. Your primary role is to analyze user requirements, Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), and an existing codebase to generate a comprehensive, step-by-step implementation plan. You will break down features into a detailed backlog, including user stories, atomic actions, file references, and testing criteria, following a structured and iterative process.
  </purpose>
  <instructions>
    <instruction>
      **Phase 1: Analysis and Objective Setting**
      1.  Thoroughly analyze all attached documents within [[user-provided-files]]. Pay special attention to:
          - A file named `repomix-output-all.md` or similar, which contains the entire application's code structure.
          - A Product Requirement Document (PRD) or a requirements file.
      2.  From the [[user-prompt]], identify the specific sprint, feature, or section that requires implementation.
      3.  Define the high-level objective for implementing this feature based on the PRD and user prompt.
    </instruction>
    <instruction>
      **Phase 2: Iterative Backlog Generation**
      For each distinct requirement or user story within the specified sprint/feature, you will perform the following loop:
      1.  **Draft User Story**: Write a clear user story with a role, goal, and outcome.
      2.  **Define Workflow**: Outline the high-level workflow needed for implementation.
      3.  **Codebase Review**: Search the `repomix` file to identify existing code, components, or files that can be reused or need to be modified.
      4.  **Identify File Changes**: Determine the exact list of files that need to be created or amended.
      5.  **Detail Actions to Undertake**: Create a granular, step-by-step list of actions. Each action must be atomic and include:
          - `Filepath`: The full path to the file being changed.
          - `Action`: A description of the change (e.g., "Add new method `calculateTotal` to class `Billing`").
          - `Implementation`: The precise code snippet to be added or modified.
          - `Imports`: Any new import statements required for the change.
      6.  **Define Acceptance Criteria**: Write clear, measurable criteria for the user story to be considered complete.
      7.  **Outline Testing Plan**: Propose specific test cases to validate the functionality.
      8.  **Review and Refine**: Briefly review the drafted user story and actions to ensure they align with the main objective before moving to the next story.
    </instruction>
    <instruction>
      **Phase 3: Final Output Compilation**
      1.  Consolidate the entire backlog into separate, well-formatted Markdown canvas document.
      2.  Use clear headings and subheadings as demonstrated in the examples.
      3.  Ensure the final output is logical, easy to follow, and provides a clear roadmap for a developer to implement the changes.
        Note: please ensure each backlog is in a separate canvas document.
    </instruction>
  </instructions>
  <examples>
    <example>
      <user-request>
        Focus on the "User Logout" feature. The PRD specifies a logout button should be added to the main navigation bar. The `repomix` file shows a React component called `Navbar.js`.
      </user-request>
      <output>
        ### User Story 1: User Logout
        **As a** logged-in user, **I want to** click a "Logout" button in the navigation bar, **so that** I can securely end my session.

        **Actions to Undertake:**
        1.  **Filepath**: `src/components/Navbar.js`
            -   **Action**: Add a logout button element.
            -   **Implementation**: `<button onClick={handleLogout}>Logout</button>`
            -   **Imports**: `import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';`
        2.  **Filepath**: `src/components/Navbar.js`
            -   **Action**: Implement the `handleLogout` function.
            -   **Implementation**: `const { logout } = useAuth(); const handleLogout = () => { logout(); };`
            -   **Imports**: None.
        3.  **Filepath**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.js`
            -   **Action**: Ensure a `logout` function exists that clears the user's session.
            -   **Implementation**: `const logout = () => { setUser(null); localStorage.removeItem('authToken'); };`
            -   **Imports**: None.

        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        -   A "Logout" button is visible in the Navbar.
        -   Clicking the button clears the user's session and redirects to the login page.

        **Testing Plan:**
        -   **Test Case 1**: Log in and verify the "Logout" button appears.
        -   **Test Case 2**: Click the "Logout" button and confirm the user is redirected and the session is cleared.
      </output>
    </example>
    <example>
      <user-request>
        Implement the "Character Counter" for the new post input field as per the PRD. The `repomix` file shows a component at `src/features/posts/NewPost.js`.
      </user-request>
      <output>
        ### User Story 2: Post Character Counter
        **As a** user writing a new post, **I want to** see a character counter below the text input, **so that** I know how close I am to the character limit (280).

        **Actions to Undertake:**
        1.  **Filepath**: `src/features/posts/NewPost.js`
            -   **Action**: Add a state variable to track the input text.
            -   **Implementation**: `const [content, setContent] = useState('');`
            -   **Imports**: `import { useState } from 'react';`
        2.  **Filepath**: `src/features/posts/NewPost.js`
            -   **Action**: Update the `textarea` to use the new state.
            -   **Implementation**: `<textarea value={content} onChange={(e) => setContent(e.target.value)} maxLength="280" />`
            -   **Imports**: None.
        3.  **Filepath**: `src/features/posts/NewPost.js`
            -   **Action**: Add a character counter display element.
            -   **Implementation**: `<p>{content.length} / 280</p>`
            -   **Imports**: None.

        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        -   As the user types in the textarea, a counter below it updates in real-time.
        -   The counter format is "current_length / 280".
        -   The user cannot type more than 280 characters.

        **Testing Plan:**
        -   **Test Case 1**: Type 50 characters and verify the counter shows "50 / 280".
        -   **Test Case 2**: Clear the text and verify the counter shows "0 / 280".
        -   **Test Case 3**: Try to paste 300 characters and verify only 280 are accepted.
      </output>
    </example>
    <example>
      <user-request>
        Create a new "Settings" page that is currently just a placeholder. The PRD states it should be accessible from the main app router.
      </user-request>
      <output>
        ### User Story 3: Create Settings Page
        **As a** user, **I want to** navigate to a "Settings" page, **so that** I can manage my account preferences in the future.

        **List of Files to be Created:**
        -   `src/pages/Settings.js`

        **Actions to Undertake:**
        1.  **Filepath**: `src/pages/Settings.js` (New File)
            -   **Action**: Create a placeholder React component for the Settings page.
            -   **Implementation**: `import React from 'react';

const Settings = () => {
  return <h1>Settings Page</h1>;
};

export default Settings;`
            -   **Imports**: `import React from 'react';`
        2.  **Filepath**: `src/App.js`
            -   **Action**: Add a new route for the Settings page.
            -   **Implementation**: `<Route path="/settings" element={<Settings />} />`
            -   **Imports**: `import Settings from './pages/Settings';`

        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        -   Navigating to the `/settings` URL renders the "Settings Page" heading.
        -   The application does not crash.

        **Testing Plan:**
        -   **Test Case 1**: Manually navigate to `/settings` in the browser and verify the page loads with the correct heading.
      </output>

  <sections>
    <user-provided-files>
       see attached markdown files. Usually we would include the repomix file usually named 'repomix-output-all.xml' or .md or similar filename which would contain the concatenated source code and structure of the application.
	   I would also provide the prd, or high level detail of the requirement.
    </user-provided-files>
    <user-prompt>
        Following the PRD: ` ` you now have to generate backlogs for each sprint item in that PRD. ensure you undertake a detail review, web search (to add relevant api information, and implementation) before you produce each backlog. Ensure we have one new canvas for each backlog sprint item. Ensure you review and markdown or xml repomix files attached to get an understanding of the existing context.
        Create new canvas doc for sprint X and X backlog
    </user-prompt>
  </sections>
</prompt>
```

[implementation guidance template]

```
how do i implement the sprints x to x , undertake a full websearch, determine which content is suitable and then, provide code example, api information and further guidance on using external api/packages to complete the task. Review 'prd', (if available) the existing code inin your analysis. Ensure each guide is produced in their own individual canvas document
```

<instructions>

<instruction>
Step 1: Initial Repository Context Analysis.
Begin by thoroughly analyzing the entire codebase in the repository. Perform a static analysis to understand the project structure, common patterns, and key architectural components. Identify the main folders, file naming conventions, and the purpose of the primary modules. This initial, broad review is crucial for contextual understanding before focusing on specific items.
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 2: Deconstruct the Product Requirements Document (PRD).
Review the entire PRD and identify each distinct feature, task, or user story. Create a list of these individual "sprint items". This list will serve as your master checklist for the documents you need to create.
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 3: Begin Processing the First Sprint Item.
Select the first sprint item from the list you created in Step 2. All subsequent steps until the final instruction will be performed for this single item.
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 4: Conduct a Detailed Review of the Sprint Item.
Focus exclusively on the selected sprint item. Read its description, acceptance criteria, and any associated notes in the PRD. Clearly define the scope and objectives of this specific item.
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 5: Perform Targeted Web and Repository Searches.
Based on the sprint item's requirements, conduct a web search to find relevant API documentation, libraries, best practices, or potential implementation examples. Simultaneously, search within the existing codebase for any files, functions, or modules that are related to the item. This connects external research with internal context.
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 6: Create the Backlog Markdown File.
Locate the file named [backlog template]. Create a new markdown file for the sprint item. Name it appropriately (e.g., backlog_sprint_item_name.md). Populate this new file by filling out the template using the information gathered from the PRD review (Step 4) and your research (Step 5).
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 7: Create the Implementation Guidance Markdown File.
Locate the file named [implementation guidance template]. Create another new markdown file. Name it to correspond with the backlog item (e.g., implementation_sprint_item_name.md). Populate this file by filling out the template, focusing on the technical details, code-level suggestions, relevant API endpoints, and file paths you discovered during your searches (Step 5).
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 8: Save the New Files.
Ensure both newly created markdown files (the backlog and the implementation guidance) are saved in the same folder where this prompt file is located.
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 9: Repeat for All Remaining Sprint Items.
If there are more sprint items on your list from Step 2, return to Step 3 and repeat the entire process (Steps 3 through 8) for the next item. Continue this loop until a backlog and an implementation guidance file have been created for every single item on your list.
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 10: Final Verification.
Once all sprint items have been processed, perform a final check. Verify that for every item identified in the PRD, there are exactly two corresponding markdown files (one backlog, one implementation guidance) located in the correct folder.
</instruction>

</instructions>

<notes>
<note>
Note 1: Template Adherence.
You must strictly use the provided [backlog template] and [implementation guidance template] for all generated files. Do not deviate from their structure.
</note>
<note>
Note 2: One-to-One File-to-Item Ratio.
For every single sprint item identified in the PRD, you must produce exactly one backlog markdown file and one implementation guidance markdown file.
</note>
<note>
Note 3: Naming Conventions.
All new files must follow a consistent naming convention that clearly links them to the sprint item, for example: backlog_sprint_item_name.md and implementation_sprint_item_name.md.
</note>
<note>
Note 4: File Location.
All generated markdown files must be created and saved in the exact same folder as the prompt file.
</note>
<note>
Note 5: Atomic Processing.
Each sprint item must be processed individually and completely (from detailed review to file creation) before moving to the next item. Do not batch-process steps.
</note>
<note>
Note 6: Foundational Analysis.
The initial repository context analysis (Step 1) is mandatory and must be completed before processing any sprint items. This step is critical for providing relevant and accurate guidance.

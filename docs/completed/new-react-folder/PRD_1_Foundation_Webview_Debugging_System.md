# PRD 1: Foundational Webview Debugging & Multi-Implementation System

## 1. Title & Overview

**Project:** VS Code Extension Webview Debugging & Multi-Implementation Framework  
**Summary:** This phase establishes a robust debugging and testing framework for VS Code extension webviews, specifically addressing Remote SSH compatibility issues. The foundation includes multiple webview implementations (React, Simple Svelte, SvelteKit), comprehensive logging, and progressive testing capabilities to isolate and resolve webview loading failures.  
**Dependencies:** Existing VS Code extension infrastructure, webview management system, and build toolchain.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

**Business Objectives:**
- Eliminate webview loading failures in Remote SSH environments
- Reduce debugging time for webview issues from hours to minutes
- Establish reliable webview implementations that work across all VS Code environments
- Create a systematic approach to webview troubleshooting

**Developer Success Metrics:**
- Webview loads successfully in both local and Remote SSH environments 100% of the time
- Debugging information is available through centralized logging within 30 seconds of issue occurrence
- Alternative webview implementations can be switched via configuration in under 2 minutes
- New developers can diagnose webview issues using built-in diagnostic tools

## 3. User Personas

**Alex (Extension Developer):** Needs reliable webview functionality across all VS Code environments, especially Remote SSH. Requires comprehensive debugging tools to quickly identify and resolve webview loading issues.

**Sarah (Remote Developer):** Works primarily in Remote SSH environments and experiences frequent webview loading failures. Needs a stable, working webview interface for the Code Context Engine extension.

**David (DevOps Engineer):** Responsible for ensuring the extension works reliably in containerized and remote development environments. Needs diagnostic tools to troubleshoot deployment issues.

## 4. Requirements Breakdown

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
|-------|--------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | **Sprint 1: Multi-Implementation Framework** | As Alex, I want multiple webview implementations (React, Simple Svelte, SvelteKit) so I can test different approaches to resolve loading issues. | 1. Three separate webview implementations are built and functional<br>2. Configuration setting allows switching between implementations<br>3. Each implementation includes VS Code API initialization and message passing<br>4. Build system produces optimized bundles for each implementation | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As Alex, I want dynamic resource loading that adapts to the chosen implementation so resources load correctly regardless of the webview type. | 1. `localResourceRoots` configuration dynamically adjusts based on implementation<br>2. Asset path rewriting works for all three implementations<br>3. CSP headers are correctly configured for each implementation<br>4. No hardcoded paths remain in the webview manager | |
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | **Sprint 2: Diagnostic & Logging System** | As Alex, I want comprehensive webview message logging so I can track communication between extension and webview. | 1. All webview messages are logged with timestamps and source identification<br>2. `webviewReady` messages are explicitly logged for each implementation<br>3. Failed message attempts are logged with error details<br>4. Logs are accessible through VS Code's Output channel | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As Sarah, I want a basic test mode that verifies VS Code API functionality so I can confirm the webview environment is working before loading complex UI. | 1. `basicTestMode` setting serves minimal diagnostic HTML<br>2. Test mode verifies VS Code API acquisition with retry logic<br>3. Test mode displays real-time status and logs in the webview<br>4. Test mode works in both local and Remote SSH environments | |

## 5. Timeline & Sprints

**Total Estimated Time:** 4 Weeks
- **Sprint 1:** Multi-Implementation Framework (2 Weeks)
- **Sprint 2:** Diagnostic & Logging System (2 Weeks)

## 6. Risks & Assumptions

**Assumptions:**
- The core VS Code extension infrastructure is stable and functional
- Remote SSH environments have proper network connectivity for resource loading
- The existing SvelteKit implementation issues are related to routing/SSR rather than fundamental webview problems

**Risks:**
- **Risk:** React implementation may have different CSP requirements than Svelte implementations
  - **Mitigation:** Implement flexible CSP configuration that adapts to implementation type
- **Risk:** Resource loading issues may persist across all implementations in Remote SSH
  - **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive resource loading diagnostics and fallback mechanisms
- **Risk:** Message passing timing issues may affect all implementations
  - **Mitigation:** Implement retry logic and timeout handling for all webview communications

## 7. Success Metrics

- All three webview implementations load successfully in local VS Code environment
- At least one implementation loads successfully in Remote SSH environment
- Diagnostic logging provides actionable information for troubleshooting failures
- Basic test mode successfully verifies VS Code API functionality in all environments
- Configuration switching between implementations works without extension reload

# Task List: Sprint 3 - Auto-Recovery & Health Monitoring

**Goal:** To implement automatic recovery mechanisms and comprehensive health monitoring for proactive webview issue detection and resolution.

| Task ID | Status | Task Description (Sequential & Atomic Steps) | File(s) To Modify |
|---------|--------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **3.1** | ☐ To Do | **Add Connection State Tracking:** Implement connection state monitoring in all webview implementations with heartbeat mechanism and latency tracking. | `webview-react/src/App.tsx`, `webview-simple/src/App.svelte`, `webview/src/lib/vscodeApi.ts` |
| **3.2** | ☐ To Do | **Implement Heartbeat System:** Create periodic heartbeat messages between webview and extension to detect connection issues within 10 seconds. | All webview implementations, `src/webviewManager.ts` |
| **3.3** | ☐ To Do | **Create Exponential Backoff Logic:** Implement reconnection attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s max) and retry limits. | All webview implementations |
| **3.4** | ☐ To Do | **Add Connection Status UI:** Create visual connection status indicators with reconnection progress and manual reconnection options. | All webview implementations |
| **3.5** | ☐ To Do | **Implement State Preservation:** Add logic to save and restore critical webview state during connection interruptions to prevent data loss. | All webview implementations |
| **3.6** | ☐ To Do | **Create Message Queuing:** Implement message queue for storing messages during disconnection periods with proper ordering and deduplication. | All webview implementations |
| **3.7** | ☐ To Do | **Add Performance Metrics Collection:** Implement tracking for load times, memory usage, message latency, and resource loading performance. | All webview implementations, `src/webviewManager.ts` |
| **3.8** | ☐ To Do | **Implement Error Tracking System:** Create error categorization, frequency tracking, and context collection for debugging purposes. | All webview implementations, `src/webviewManager.ts` |
| **3.9** | ☐ To Do | **Create Health Status API:** Implement health check endpoint and real-time metrics reporting via message passing to extension. | All webview implementations, `src/webviewManager.ts` |
| **3.10** | ☐ To Do | **Add Configurable Alerting:** Implement threshold-based alerting system with different severity levels and VS Code notification integration. | `src/webviewManager.ts`, `package.json` |
| **3.11** | ☐ To Do | **Add Health Monitoring Settings:** Create VS Code configuration properties for health monitoring thresholds and alerting preferences. | `package.json` |
| **3.12** | ☐ To Do | **Test Auto-Recovery in Remote SSH:** Validate that auto-recovery mechanisms work correctly in Remote SSH environments with simulated network interruptions. | Remote SSH Environment Testing |
| **3.13** | ☐ To Do | **Verify Health Metrics Accuracy:** Test that performance metrics and error tracking provide accurate and actionable information for debugging. | All Environments Testing |

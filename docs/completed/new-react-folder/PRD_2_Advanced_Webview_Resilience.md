# PRD 2: Advanced Webview Resilience & Production Optimization

## 1. Title & Overview

**Project:** Advanced Webview Resilience & Production Optimization  
**Summary:** This phase builds upon the foundational debugging system by implementing advanced resilience features, performance optimizations, and production-ready error handling. The focus is on creating a self-healing webview system that can recover from failures and provide optimal user experience across all VS Code environments.  
**Dependencies:** PRD 1 must be complete. Multi-implementation framework and diagnostic logging must be functional.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

**Business Objectives:**
- Achieve 99.9% webview uptime across all supported environments
- Implement automatic recovery mechanisms for common failure scenarios
- Optimize webview performance for low-bandwidth Remote SSH connections
- Establish monitoring and alerting for webview health

**Developer Success Metrics:**
- Webview automatically recovers from 90% of transient failures without user intervention
- Initial webview load time is under 3 seconds in Remote SSH environments
- Memory usage remains stable during extended webview sessions
- Error recovery mechanisms are triggered and logged appropriately

## 3. User Personas

**Sarah (Remote Developer):** Experiences occasional network interruptions and needs the webview to recover gracefully without losing work or requiring manual intervention.

**Mike (Performance-Conscious Developer):** Works on large codebases and needs the webview to remain responsive and memory-efficient during extended coding sessions.

**Lisa (Enterprise Developer):** Works in corporate environments with strict security policies and needs robust error handling and monitoring capabilities.

## 4. Requirements Breakdown

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
|-------|--------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Phase 2: Resilience** | **Sprint 3: Auto-Recovery & Health Monitoring** | As Sarah, I want the webview to automatically detect and recover from communication failures so I don't lose functionality during network interruptions. | 1. Webview detects when communication with extension is lost<br>2. Automatic reconnection attempts with exponential backoff<br>3. UI displays connection status and recovery progress<br>4. Successful recovery restores full functionality without data loss | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As Lisa, I want comprehensive health monitoring that tracks webview performance and errors so issues can be identified proactively. | 1. Performance metrics collection (load time, memory usage, message latency)<br>2. Error tracking with categorization and frequency analysis<br>3. Health status API accessible to extension and external monitoring<br>4. Configurable alerting thresholds for critical metrics | |
| **Phase 2: Resilience** | **Sprint 4: Performance Optimization & Caching** | As Mike, I want optimized resource loading and caching so the webview performs well even with large codebases and slow connections. | 1. Intelligent resource bundling minimizes HTTP requests<br>2. Progressive loading for non-critical UI components<br>3. Local caching of static assets with cache invalidation<br>4. Lazy loading of heavy components until needed | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As Sarah, I want graceful degradation when network conditions are poor so I can continue working with reduced functionality rather than complete failure. | 1. Offline mode with cached data and limited functionality<br>2. Bandwidth detection and adaptive UI complexity<br>3. Queue-based message handling for unreliable connections<br>4. User notification of degraded mode with recovery options | |

## 5. Timeline & Sprints

**Total Estimated Time:** 4 Weeks
- **Sprint 3:** Auto-Recovery & Health Monitoring (2 Weeks)
- **Sprint 4:** Performance Optimization & Caching (2 Weeks)

## 6. Risks & Assumptions

**Assumptions:**
- Network interruptions in Remote SSH are temporary and recoverable
- Users prefer degraded functionality over complete failure
- Performance bottlenecks are primarily related to resource loading rather than computation

**Risks:**
- **Risk:** Auto-recovery mechanisms may mask underlying infrastructure issues
  - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive logging and alerting ensure issues are still visible to developers
- **Risk:** Caching mechanisms may cause stale data issues
  - **Mitigation:** Implement robust cache invalidation and version checking
- **Risk:** Performance optimizations may increase complexity and introduce new failure modes
  - **Mitigation:** Gradual rollout with feature flags and comprehensive testing

## 7. Success Metrics

- 95% reduction in user-reported webview failures
- Average webview load time under 3 seconds in Remote SSH
- Memory usage remains stable over 8-hour sessions
- Auto-recovery success rate above 90% for transient failures
- Zero data loss incidents during network interruptions

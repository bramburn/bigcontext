### **New Document: PRD 2: Backend Foundation - C\# Web API & Extensible Clients**

**1. Title & Overview**

  * **Project:** Code Context Engine - C\# Backend Foundation
  * **Summary:** This phase covers the creation of a robust, standalone C\# ASP.NET Core Web API. This backend service will handle all heavy lifting, including code parsing, vectorization, and database communication. The architecture will be designed for extensibility from day one, using dependency injection and abstract client interfaces to easily support various databases and embedding providers in the future.
  * **Dependencies:** Requires the .NET SDK and a C\# development environment (like VS Code with the C\# Dev Kit or Visual Studio).

-----

**2. Goals & Success Metrics**

  * **Business Objectives:**
      * Decouple the core processing logic from the VS Code extension frontend, allowing for more robust and scalable development.
      * Create a flexible architecture that can adapt to new technologies (databases, embedding models) without significant refactoring.
  * **Developer & System Success Metrics:**
      * The C\# Web API project is successfully created and can be run locally.
      * A basic `/health` endpoint returns a `200 OK` status.
      * The service architecture correctly implements the strategy or factory pattern for database and embedding clients.
      * The solution includes separate class library projects for core logic, infrastructure, and the API, promoting clean architecture.
      * Unit tests are in place for the client abstraction layer.

-----

**3. User Personas**

  * **Alisha (Backend Developer):** Alisha is responsible for building and maintaining the core indexing engine. She needs a well-structured, testable, and maintainable codebase that follows best practices for C\# development, such as dependency injection and clear separation of concerns.
  * **Devin (Developer - End User):** While Devin doesn't interact with this backend directly, he will benefit from its stability and performance. A well-architected backend ensures the indexing process is fast, reliable, and less prone to crashing.

-----

**4. Requirements Breakdown**

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 2: Backend** | **Sprint 1: C\# Web API Boilerplate** | As Alisha, I want to create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project so we have the foundational service for our backend logic. | 1. A new .NET solution is created containing a Web API project.\<br/\>2. The API is configured to use minimal API syntax for endpoints.\<br/\>3. A basic `/health` endpoint is implemented that returns a success status.\<br/\>4. The project includes Swagger/OpenAPI support for API documentation and testing. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As Alisha, I want to establish a clean architecture with separate projects for Core, Infrastructure, and API so that our codebase is organized and maintainable. | 1. The solution is organized into `CodeContext.Api`, `CodeContext.Core` (for domain logic/interfaces), and `CodeContext.Infrastructure` (for external clients).\<br/\>2. Project references are set up correctly (e.g., API depends on Core and Infrastructure).\<br/\>3. Basic folders and classes are created in each project to establish the structure. | |
| **Phase 2: Backend** | **Sprint 2: Extensible Client Framework** | As Alisha, I want to define abstract interfaces for database clients and embedding providers so we can easily add new implementations in the future. | 1. An `IEmbeddingProvider` interface with a `GenerateEmbeddingsAsync` method is created in `CodeContext.Core`.\<br/\>2. An `IVectorDatabaseClient` interface with `UpsertAsync` and `QueryAsync` methods is created in `CodeContext.Core`.\<br/\>3. These interfaces are agnostic of any specific technology (e.g., they use generic data types). | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As Alisha, I want to use dependency injection to register and resolve these clients so that the application is loosely coupled and testable. | 1. .NET's built-in dependency injection container is configured in `Program.cs`.\<br/\>2. A "factory" or "strategy" service is created that can resolve the correct client implementation based on a configuration string (e.g., "qdrant", "ollama").\<br/\>3. Unit tests are written to verify that the correct client is returned for a given configuration. | |

-----

**5. Timeline & Sprints**

  * **Total Estimated Time:** 4 Weeks
  * **Sprint 1:** C\# Web API Boilerplate (2 Weeks)
  * **Sprint 2:** Extensible Client Framework (2 Weeks)

-----

**6. Risks & Assumptions**

  * **Assumption:** The development team is proficient in C\# and the .NET ecosystem.
  * **Risk:** Over-engineering the client framework. The initial design for the abstractions might be too complex for the immediate need.
      * **Mitigation:** Start with a simple interface and concrete implementation first (e.g., for Qdrant). Refactor to a more abstract factory pattern only when adding the second client (e.g., ChromaDB), following the rule of three.
  * **Risk:** Communication between the TypeScript extension and a C\# process can be complex to manage (e.g., starting, stopping, and handling errors).
      * **Mitigation:** This risk is primarily addressed in PRD 3, but in this phase, ensure the C\# API is simple and stateless (standard HTTP requests) to minimize integration complexity.

### **New Document: PRD 3: VS Code Integration & UI Onboarding**

**1. Title & Overview**

  * **Project:** Code Context Engine - VS Code Integration & Onboarding
  * **Summary:** This phase focuses on the user's first experience. It involves building the Svelte UI for the initial setup and creating the TypeScript logic within the VS Code extension to manage the C\# backend process. This includes detecting when a repository hasn't been indexed, guiding the user through database and embedding model selection, and providing helper buttons to run Docker commands.
  * **Dependencies:** PRD 1 and PRD 2 must be complete. The C\# backend must be buildable and runnable from the command line.

-----

**2. Goals & Success Metrics**

  * **Business Objectives:**
      * Create a smooth and intuitive onboarding experience to maximize user activation.
      * Abstract away technical complexity (like running Docker) to make the tool accessible to a wider range of developers.
  * **Developer & System Success Metrics:**
      * The TypeScript extension can successfully spawn the C\# backend as a child process.
      * The extension can reliably check the health of the C\# backend by polling the `/health` endpoint.
      * The Svelte UI correctly displays the setup screen when no index configuration is found.
      * Clicking the "Start Database" button in the UI successfully opens a new VS Code terminal and runs the `docker-compose up` command.
      * The UI state updates correctly to show that the database is "running" after a successful health check.

-----

**4. Requirements Breakdown**

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 3: Integration & UI** | **Sprint 3: Backend Process Management** | As a developer, I want the VS Code extension to automatically start the C\# backend service when the extension is activated, so I don't have to run it manually. | 1. The extension uses Node.js's `child_process.spawn` to launch the compiled C\# executable.\<br/\>2. The extension correctly captures `stdout` and `stderr` from the C\# process for logging.\<br/\>3. The child process is automatically terminated when the extension is deactivated or VS Code is closed. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As a developer, I want the extension to monitor the health of the C\# backend service so it can reliably send API requests. | 1. The extension periodically sends an HTTP GET request to the backend's `/health` endpoint.\<br/\>2. The UI state reflects whether the backend is "Starting", "Running", or "Error".\<br/\>3. If the health check fails multiple times, the process is restarted. | |
| **Phase 3: Integration & UI** | **Sprint 4: Onboarding & Setup UI** | As Devin, when I open a new project, I want the extension to check if it's been indexed and show me a setup screen if it hasn't. | 1. On activation, the extension looks for the `code-context.json` file in the `.vscode` directory.\<br/\>2. If the file is not found, the main webview panel displays the "Setup" component.\<br/\>3. If the file is found, the main webview panel displays the "Query" component (to be built later). | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As Devin, I want the setup screen to let me choose my database and embedding provider, with helper buttons to start any required local services. | 1. The UI presents dropdowns for selecting a database (Qdrant, etc.) and embedding provider (Ollama, etc.).\<br/\>2. A button next to the database selection ("Start Local Qdrant") is present.\<br/\>3. Clicking the button creates a new VS Code terminal and runs the appropriate `docker-compose` command.\<br/\>4. The UI shows a success indicator once the service is confirmed to be running via a health check. | |

-----

**5. Timeline & Sprints**

  * **Total Estimated Time:** 4 Weeks
  * **Sprint 3:** Backend Process Management (2 Weeks)
  * **Sprint 4:** Onboarding & Setup UI (2 Weeks)

-----

**6. Risks & Assumptions**

  * **Assumption:** The C\# backend executable can be reliably located and run from the TypeScript extension across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
  * **Risk:** Managing the lifecycle of the child C\# process could be buggy, leading to orphaned processes that consume system resources.
      * **Mitigation:** Implement robust error handling and ensure the process is always killed in the `deactivate` function of the extension. Use libraries like `tree-kill` if necessary to ensure the entire process tree is terminated.
  * **Risk:** The user may not have Docker installed or running, causing the helper commands to fail.
      * **Mitigation:** Provide clear error messages in the UI and terminal. The UI should check for the `docker` command on the system's PATH and disable the button with a helpful tooltip if it's not found.

Of course. Here are the final PRDs and their associated task lists, completing the project roadmap.

### **New Document: PRD 4: Core Functionality - End-to-End Indexing & Querying**

**1. Title & Overview**

  * **Project:** Code Context Engine - Core Functionality Implementation
  * **Summary:** This phase is about bringing the core user journey to life. It involves implementing the first concrete clients for Qdrant and Ollama within the C\# backend. We will then connect the UI to the backend to create a seamless, end-to-end indexing workflow. Finally, we will build the initial chat/query interface, allowing users to ask their first questions and receive contextually relevant answers from their indexed codebase.
  * **Dependencies:** PRD 3 must be complete. The extension must be able to manage the C\# backend process and display the initial setup UI.

-----

**2. Goals & Success Metrics**

  * **Business Objectives:**
      * Deliver the "Aha\!" moment for the user by providing the first tangible results from their indexed code.
      * Validate the end-to-end architecture, from UI interaction to backend processing and back.
  * **Developer & System Success Metrics:**
      * The C\# backend can successfully generate embeddings using a local Ollama instance and store them in a local Qdrant database.
      * The `IndexingService` in the C\# backend correctly orchestrates the full pipeline: AST parsing, embedding, and database upserting.
      * The UI's "Index Now" button successfully triggers the indexing process via an API call to the C\# backend.
      * The UI displays a real-time progress bar that accurately reflects the status sent from the backend.
      * A user can type a query into the main chat box, and the extension will return a list of relevant file paths based on a vector search.

-----

**3. User Personas**

  * **Devin (Developer - End User):** Devin has just completed the initial setup. He now wants to see the extension in action. He needs a simple interface to start the indexing, see that it's working, and then ask a basic question to see if the tool can find relevant code for him.

-----

**4. Requirements Breakdown**

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 4: Core Functionality** | **Sprint 5: Concrete Client Implementation (C\#)** | As Alisha, I want to implement the concrete client for Qdrant so that the backend can communicate with the vector database. | 1. A `QdrantClient` class is created in the Infrastructure project that implements `IVectorDatabaseClient`.\<br/\>2. The client correctly connects to the Qdrant instance specified in the configuration.\<br/\>3. The `UpsertAsync` method successfully saves vectors and their payloads to the database. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As Alisha, I want to implement the concrete client for Ollama so that the backend can generate embeddings. | 1. An `OllamaProvider` class is created that implements `IEmbeddingProvider`.\<br/\>2. The provider makes successful HTTP POST requests to a local Ollama `/api/embeddings` endpoint.\<br/\>3. The class correctly parses the response to extract the embedding vectors.\<br/\>4. The implementation is registered with the dependency injection container. | |
| **Phase 4: Core Functionality** | **Sprint 6: End-to-End Indexing & Query UI** | As Devin, I want to click the "Index Now" button and see a progress bar while my code is being indexed so I have clear feedback on the process. | 1. Clicking the "Index Now" button in the Svelte UI sends a `POST /index` request to the C\# backend.\<br/\>2. The backend streams progress updates (e.g., via Server-Sent Events or WebSockets) back to the UI.\<br/\>3. The Fluent UI progress bar in the Svelte component updates based on the events received from the backend.\<br/\>4. The UI transitions to the "Query" view upon receiving a "completed" event. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As Devin, after indexing is complete, I want to see a chat input box where I can type a question to find relevant code. | 1. A new "Query" Svelte component is created, featuring a text input and a submit button.\<br/\>2. Typing a query and hitting Enter sends a `POST /query` request to the C\# backend with the query text.\<br/\>3. The backend performs a vector search using the query and returns a list of file paths.\<br/\>4. The UI displays the returned file paths as a simple list. | |

-----

**5. Timeline & Sprints**

  * **Total Estimated Time:** 4 Weeks
  * **Sprint 5:** Concrete Client Implementation (C\#) (2 Weeks)
  * **Sprint 6:** End-to-End Indexing & Query UI (2 Weeks)

-----

**6. Risks & Assumptions**

  * **Assumption:** The selected Ollama embedding model provides sufficiently accurate embeddings for code to yield relevant search results.
  * **Risk:** The real-time progress update mechanism (e.g., SSE or WebSockets) could be complex to implement between the C\# backend and the VS Code webview.
      * **Mitigation:** Start with a simpler polling mechanism if a streaming approach proves too difficult. The frontend can poll a `/index/status` endpoint on the backend every few seconds to get the progress.
  * **Risk:** The performance of the end-to-end indexing on a large repository might be slow, leading to a poor user experience.
      * **Mitigation:** Focus on optimizing the "hot path" in the C\# backend—specifically, batching requests to the embedding provider and the database client to improve throughput.

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 5: Polish** | **Sprint 7: Settings Management & Re-Indexing** | As Devin, I want a settings icon in the UI so I can go back and change my database or embedding provider at any time. | 1. A "cog" icon is added to the main UI panel.\<br/\>2. Clicking the icon navigates the webview to the "Setup" component, pre-filled with the current configuration.\<br/\>3. The current configuration is read from the `code-context.json` file. | **2 Weeks** |

### **New Document: PRD 2: UI/UX - Indexing Progress View**

**1. Title & Overview**

  * **Project:** Code Context Engine - Indexing Progress UI
  * **Summary:** This phase is dedicated to building the UI that provides users with clear, real-time feedback while their repository is being indexed. A well-executed progress view is crucial for user trust, as it communicates that the extension is working and prevents the perception of it being frozen or broken during a potentially long-running task.
  * **Dependencies:** PRD 1 (Onboarding & Setup UI) must be complete. The C\# backend must provide an endpoint (either WebSocket or SSE) that streams progress updates.

-----

**2. Goals & Success Metrics**

  * **Business Objectives:**
      * Improve user retention during the initial, critical indexing phase by providing a transparent and informative experience.
      * Reduce user friction and prevent premature cancellation of the indexing process.
  * **User Success Metrics:**
      * The progress bar accurately reflects the real-world progress of the indexing job with less than a 5% margin of error.
      * The status text updates clearly, informing the user of the current stage (e.g., "Parsing files", "Generating embeddings").
      * User-initiated cancellations of the indexing process are below 10%.

-----

**3. User Personas**

  * **Devin (Developer - End User):** After clicking "Index Now," Devin expects immediate feedback. He wants to see that the process has started and get a reasonable estimate of how long it might take. Clear progress indicators give him the confidence to let the extension run while he works on other things.

-----

**4. Requirements Breakdown**

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 2: Progress UI** | **Sprint 2: Progress View Implementation** | As Devin, after starting the indexing, I want to see a dedicated view with a progress bar so I know that the process is running. | 1. After the "startIndexing" message is sent, the webview immediately transitions to the `IndexingProgressView` component.\<br/\>2. A Fluent UI `<ProgressBar>` is prominently displayed.\<br/\>3. A text label below the bar shows the current percentage and a status message (e.g., "0% - Initializing..."). | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As Devin, I want the progress bar and status text to update in real-time as the indexing proceeds through different stages. | 1. The SvelteKit frontend successfully establishes a connection to the backend's progress streaming endpoint.\<br/\>2. The progress bar's value is reactively bound to the percentage received from the backend.\<br/\>3. The status text updates to reflect the messages sent from the backend (e.g., file names, current stage).\<br/\>4. The UI gracefully handles a dropped connection and attempts to reconnect. | |
| | | As Devin, I want the view to automatically switch to the main query interface once the indexing is complete. | 1. Upon receiving a "completed" event from the backend, the progress bar fills to 100%.\<br/\>2. A "Complete" message is briefly displayed.\<br/\>3. After a short delay (e.g., 1-2 seconds), the application state changes, and the `QueryView` component is rendered. | |

-----

**5. Timeline & Sprints**

  * **Total Estimated Time:** 2 Weeks
  * **Sprint 2:** Progress View Implementation (2 Weeks)

-----

**6. Risks & Assumptions**

  * **Assumption:** The backend can provide reasonably accurate progress percentages. If the backend can only provide status messages, the progress bar might need to be an indeterminate one.
  * **Risk:** A WebSocket or SSE connection between the VS Code webview and a local C\# process might be blocked by local firewall or security software.
      * **Mitigation:** Provide a fallback mechanism where the UI polls a standard HTTP endpoint (`GET /index/status`) every few seconds. This is less efficient but more reliable.
  * **Risk:** The UI might become unresponsive if it receives a very high frequency of progress updates from the backend.
      * **Mitigation:** Implement throttling or debouncing on the frontend to ensure the UI only re-renders at a reasonable interval (e.g., every 100-200ms).

### **New Document: Sub-Sprint 3: Backend Connection for Progress Updates**

**Objective:**
To establish the communication channel from the SvelteKit frontend to the C\# backend to receive real-time progress events.

**Parent Sprint:**
PRD 2, Sprint 2: Progress View Implementation

**Tasks:**

1.  **Choose Streaming Technology:** Decide on the technology for real-time updates (WebSockets are a good choice for this).
2.  **Implement WebSocket Client:** In the SvelteKit app, create a service that connects to the C\# backend's WebSocket endpoint when the indexing view is loaded.
3.  **Create Progress Store:** Implement a new Svelte store (`progressStore.ts`) to hold the current percentage and status message.
4.  **Update Store on Message:** The WebSocket client, upon receiving a message from the backend, will parse the data and update the `progressStore`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  * The frontend successfully connects to the backend's WebSocket server.
  * Messages sent from the backend are correctly received and logged in the frontend's developer console.
  * The `progressStore` is accurately updated with the received data.

**Dependencies:**

  * The C\# backend must have a WebSocket or SSE endpoint that broadcasts progress.

**Timeline:**

  * **Start Date:** 2026-01-19
  * **End Date:** 2026-01-23

### **New Document: Sub-Sprint 4: Svelte Progress UI Component**

**Objective:**
To build the user-facing Svelte component that displays the indexing progress.

**Parent Sprint:**
PRD 2, Sprint 2: Progress View Implementation

**Tasks:**

1.  **Create `IndexingProgressView.svelte`:** Build the main component for this view.
2.  **Add Fluent UI ProgressBar:** Integrate and style the `<ProgressBar>` component.
3.  **Subscribe to Progress Store:** In the component's script, subscribe to the `progressStore` to get live updates.
4.  **Bind UI to Store:** Reactively bind the `value` of the progress bar and the content of the status text label to the data from the store.
5.  **Implement Completion Logic:** Use a reactive statement (`$:`) to watch for when the progress percentage reaches 100, then trigger a state change to navigate to the query view.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  * The progress bar visually updates as the value in the store changes.
  * The status text correctly displays the message from the store.
  * When progress hits 100, the UI automatically transitions to the next view.

**Dependencies:**

  * Sub-Sprint 3 must be complete.

**Timeline:**

  * **Start Date:** 2026-01-26
  * **End Date:** 2026-01-30

### **New Document: PRD 3: UI/UX - Main Query & Results View**

**1. Title & Overview**

  * **Project:** Code Context Engine - Main Query Interface
  * **Summary:** This phase covers the development of the primary user interface where developers will interact with the indexed codebase. The design will focus on simplicity and efficiency, providing a clean, chat-like experience for asking questions and receiving results. This view is the core of the product's day-to-day value.
  * **Dependencies:** The indexing process must be complete, and the C\# backend must expose a `/query` endpoint.

-----

**2. Goals & Success Metrics**

  * **Business Objectives:**
      * Drive daily active usage by providing a powerful and easy-to-use interface for code discovery.
      * Clearly demonstrate the value of the indexing process by providing fast, relevant search results.
  * **User Success Metrics:**
      * The time from submitting a query to seeing the first result is less than 2 seconds.
      * The UI for displaying results is clear and allows users to easily identify and navigate to the relevant files.
      * The settings icon is easily discoverable, allowing users to return to the configuration view when needed.

**4. Requirements Breakdown**

| Phase | Sprint | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 3: Query UI** | **Sprint 3: Query & Results Implementation** | As Devin, after my project is indexed, I want to see a simple text box where I can type my question, so I can start searching immediately. | 1. The `QueryView` component is displayed after indexing is complete.\<br/\>2. A Fluent UI `<TextField>` is shown at the bottom of the view, styled like a chat input.\<br/\>3. A "Submit" button or icon is present, and pressing "Enter" also triggers a submission. | **2 Weeks** |
| | | As Devin, when I submit a query, I want to see the list of relevant files returned by the engine, so I can find the code I'm looking for. | 1. Submitting a query sends a `POST` request to the C\# backend's `/query` endpoint.\<br/\>2. While waiting for a response, a loading indicator is displayed.\<br/\>3. The returned list of file paths is displayed in a clean, scrollable list in the main view area.\<br/\>4. Each file path is a clickable link that opens the corresponding file in a new VS Code editor tab. | |
| | | As Devin, I want to be able to easily access the settings to re-configure my project, so I can change the embedding model or database later. | 1. A "cog" icon is displayed in the top-right corner of the view.\<br/\>2. Clicking the icon navigates the user back to the `SetupView` component.\<br/\>3. The `SetupView` is pre-populated with the project's current, saved configuration. | |

```
<prompt>
  <purpose>
    You are an expert AI Project Manager and Senior Software Architect. Your primary role is to analyze user requirements, Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), and an existing codebase to generate a comprehensive, step-by-step implementation plan. You will break down features into a detailed backlog, including user stories, atomic actions, file references, and testing criteria, following a structured and iterative process.
  </purpose>
  <instructions>
    <instruction>
      **Phase 1: Analysis and Objective Setting**
      1.  Thoroughly analyze all attached documents within [[user-provided-files]]. Pay special attention to:
          - A file named `repomix-output-all.md` or similar, which contains the entire application's code structure.
          - A Product Requirement Document (PRD) or a requirements file.
      2.  From the [[user-prompt]], identify the specific sprint, feature, or section that requires implementation.
      3.  Define the high-level objective for implementing this feature based on the PRD and user prompt.
    </instruction>
    <instruction>
      **Phase 2: Iterative Backlog Generation**
      For each distinct requirement or user story within the specified sprint/feature, you will perform the following loop:
      1.  **Draft User Story**: Write a clear user story with a role, goal, and outcome.
      2.  **Define Workflow**: Outline the high-level workflow needed for implementation.
      3.  **Codebase Review**: Search the `repomix` file to identify existing code, components, or files that can be reused or need to be modified.
      4.  **Identify File Changes**: Determine the exact list of files that need to be created or amended.
      5.  **Detail Actions to Undertake**: Create a granular, step-by-step list of actions. Each action must be atomic and include:
          - `Filepath`: The full path to the file being changed.
          - `Action`: A description of the change (e.g., "Add new method `calculateTotal` to class `Billing`").
          - `Implementation`: The precise code snippet to be added or modified.
          - `Imports`: Any new import statements required for the change.
      6.  **Define Acceptance Criteria**: Write clear, measurable criteria for the user story to be considered complete.
      7.  **Outline Testing Plan**: Propose specific test cases to validate the functionality.
      8.  **Review and Refine**: Briefly review the drafted user story and actions to ensure they align with the main objective before moving to the next story.
    </instruction>
    <instruction>
      **Phase 3: Final Output Compilation**
      1.  Consolidate the entire backlog into separate, well-formatted Markdown canvas document.
      2.  Use clear headings and subheadings as demonstrated in the examples.
      3.  Ensure the final output is logical, easy to follow, and provides a clear roadmap for a developer to implement the changes.
        Note: please ensure each backlog is in a separate canvas document.
    </instruction>
  </instructions>
  <examples>
    <example>
      <user-request>
        Focus on the "User Logout" feature. The PRD specifies a logout button should be added to the main navigation bar. The `repomix` file shows a React component called `Navbar.js`.
      </user-request>
      <output>
        ### User Story 1: User Logout
        **As a** logged-in user, **I want to** click a "Logout" button in the navigation bar, **so that** I can securely end my session.

        **Actions to Undertake:**
        1.  **Filepath**: `src/components/Navbar.js`
            -   **Action**: Add a logout button element.
            -   **Implementation**: `<button onClick={handleLogout}>Logout</button>`
            -   **Imports**: `import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';`
        2.  **Filepath**: `src/components/Navbar.js`
            -   **Action**: Implement the `handleLogout` function.
            -   **Implementation**: `const { logout } = useAuth(); const handleLogout = () => { logout(); };`
            -   **Imports**: None.
        3.  **Filepath**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.js`
            -   **Action**: Ensure a `logout` function exists that clears the user's session.
            -   **Implementation**: `const logout = () => { setUser(null); localStorage.removeItem('authToken'); };`
            -   **Imports**: None.

        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        -   A "Logout" button is visible in the Navbar.
        -   Clicking the button clears the user's session and redirects to the login page.

        **Testing Plan:**
        -   **Test Case 1**: Log in and verify the "Logout" button appears.
        -   **Test Case 2**: Click the "Logout" button and confirm the user is redirected and the session is cleared.
      </output>
    </example>
    <example>
      <user-request>
        Implement the "Character Counter" for the new post input field as per the PRD. The `repomix` file shows a component at `src/features/posts/NewPost.js`.
      </user-request>
      <output>
        ### User Story 2: Post Character Counter
        **As a** user writing a new post, **I want to** see a character counter below the text input, **so that** I know how close I am to the character limit (280).

        **Actions to Undertake:**
        1.  **Filepath**: `src/features/posts/NewPost.js`
            -   **Action**: Add a state variable to track the input text.
            -   **Implementation**: `const [content, setContent] = useState('');`
            -   **Imports**: `import { useState } from 'react';`
        2.  **Filepath**: `src/features/posts/NewPost.js`
            -   **Action**: Update the `textarea` to use the new state.
            -   **Implementation**: `<textarea value={content} onChange={(e) => setContent(e.target.value)} maxLength="280" />`
            -   **Imports**: None.
        3.  **Filepath**: `src/features/posts/NewPost.js`
            -   **Action**: Add a character counter display element.
            -   **Implementation**: `<p>{content.length} / 280</p>`
            -   **Imports**: None.

        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        -   As the user types in the textarea, a counter below it updates in real-time.
        -   The counter format is "current_length / 280".
        -   The user cannot type more than 280 characters.

        **Testing Plan:**
        -   **Test Case 1**: Type 50 characters and verify the counter shows "50 / 280".
        -   **Test Case 2**: Clear the text and verify the counter shows "0 / 280".
        -   **Test Case 3**: Try to paste 300 characters and verify only 280 are accepted.
      </output>
    </example>
    <example>
      <user-request>
        Create a new "Settings" page that is currently just a placeholder. The PRD states it should be accessible from the main app router.
      </user-request>
      <output>
        ### User Story 3: Create Settings Page
        **As a** user, **I want to** navigate to a "Settings" page, **so that** I can manage my account preferences in the future.

        **List of Files to be Created:**
        -   `src/pages/Settings.js`

        **Actions to Undertake:**
        1.  **Filepath**: `src/pages/Settings.js` (New File)
            -   **Action**: Create a placeholder React component for the Settings page.
            -   **Implementation**: `import React from 'react';

const Settings = () => {
  return <h1>Settings Page</h1>;
};

export default Settings;`
            -   **Imports**: `import React from 'react';`
        2.  **Filepath**: `src/App.js`
            -   **Action**: Add a new route for the Settings page.
            -   **Implementation**: `<Route path="/settings" element={<Settings />} />`
            -   **Imports**: `import Settings from './pages/Settings';`

        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        -   Navigating to the `/settings` URL renders the "Settings Page" heading.
        -   The application does not crash.

        **Testing Plan:**
        -   **Test Case 1**: Manually navigate to `/settings` in the browser and verify the page loads with the correct heading.
      </output>
    </example>
  </examples>
  <sections>
    <user-provided-files>
       see attached markdown files. Usually we would include the repomix file usually named 'repomix-output-all.xml' or .md or similar filename which would contain the concatenated source code and structure of the application.
	   I would also provide the prd, or high level detail of the requirement.
    </user-provided-files>

        Following the PRD: ` ` you now have to generate backlogs for each sprint item in that PRD. ensure you undertake a detail review, web search (to add relevant api information, and implementation) before you produce each backlog. Ensure we have one new canvas for each backlog sprint item. Ensure you review and markdown or xml repomix files attached to get an understanding of the existing context.
        Create new canvas doc for sprint X and X backlog

</prompt>
```

[implementation guidance template]

```
how do i implement the sprints x to x , undertake a full websearch, determine which content is suitable and then, provide code example, api information and further guidance on using external api/packages to complete the task. Review 'prd', (if available) the existing code inin your analysis. Ensure each guide is produced in their own individual canvas document
```

<instructions>

<instruction>
Step 1: Initial Repository Context Analysis.
Begin by thoroughly analyzing the entire codebase in the repository. Perform a static analysis to understand the project structure, common patterns, and key architectural components. Identify the main folders, file naming conventions, and the purpose of the primary modules. This initial, broad review is crucial for contextual understanding before focusing on specific items.
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 2: Deconstruct the Product Requirements Document (PRD).
Review the entire PRD and identify each distinct feature, task, or user story. Create a list of these individual "sprint items". This list will serve as your master checklist for the documents you need to create.
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 3: Begin Processing the First Sprint Item.
Select the first sprint item from the list you created in Step 2. All subsequent steps until the final instruction will be performed for this single item.
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 4: Conduct a Detailed Review of the Sprint Item.
Focus exclusively on the selected sprint item. Read its description, acceptance criteria, and any associated notes in the PRD. Clearly define the scope and objectives of this specific item.
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 5: Perform Targeted Web and Repository Searches.
Based on the sprint item's requirements, conduct a web search to find relevant API documentation, libraries, best practices, or potential implementation examples. Simultaneously, search within the existing codebase for any files, functions, or modules that are related to the item. This connects external research with internal context.
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 6: Create the Backlog Markdown File.
Locate the file named [backlog template]. Create a new markdown file for the sprint item. Name it appropriately (e.g., backlog_sprint_item_name.md). Populate this new file by filling out the template using the information gathered from the PRD review (Step 4) and your research (Step 5).
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 7: Create the Implementation Guidance Markdown File.
Locate the file named [implementation guidance template]. Create another new markdown file. Name it to correspond with the backlog item (e.g., implementation_sprint_item_name.md). Populate this file by filling out the template, focusing on the technical details, code-level suggestions, relevant API endpoints, and file paths you discovered during your searches (Step 5).
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 8: Save the New Files.
Ensure both newly created markdown files (the backlog and the implementation guidance) are saved in the same folder where this prompt file is located.
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 9: Repeat for All Remaining Sprint Items.
If there are more sprint items on your list from Step 2, return to Step 3 and repeat the entire process (Steps 3 through 8) for the next item. Continue this loop until a backlog and an implementation guidance file have been created for every single item on your list.
</instruction>
<instruction>
Step 10: Final Verification.
Once all sprint items have been processed, perform a final check. Verify that for every item identified in the PRD, there are exactly two corresponding markdown files (one backlog, one implementation guidance) located in the correct folder.
</instruction>

</instructions>

<notes>
<note>
Note 1: Template Adherence.
You must strictly use the provided [backlog template] and [implementation guidance template] for all generated files. Do not deviate from their structure.
</note>
<note>
Note 2: One-to-One File-to-Item Ratio.
For every single sprint item identified in the PRD, you must produce exactly one backlog markdown file and one implementation guidance markdown file.
</note>
<note>
Note 3: Naming Conventions.
All new files must follow a consistent naming convention that clearly links them to the sprint item, for example: backlog_sprint_item_name.md and implementation_sprint_item_name.md.
</note>
<note>
Note 4: File Location.
All generated markdown files must be created and saved in the exact same folder as the prompt file.
</note>
<note>
Note 5: Atomic Processing.
Each sprint item must be processed individually and completely (from detailed review to file creation) before moving to the next item. Do not batch-process steps.
</note>
<note>
Note 6: Foundational Analysis.
The initial repository context analysis (Step 1) is mandatory and must be completed before processing any sprint items. This step is critical for providing relevant and accurate guidance.
</note>

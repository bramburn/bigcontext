# Data Model for Enhanced File Scanning Progress Messages

This feature primarily focuses on UI feedback and communication of progress, rather than introducing new persistent data entities. Therefore, no new data models are defined for this feature.

Existing data structures related to file paths, counts, and status messages will be utilized and communicated between the backend (src/) and frontend (webview-react/) as needed.

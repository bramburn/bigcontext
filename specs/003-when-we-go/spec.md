# Feature Specification: Enhanced File Scanning Progress Messages

**Feature Branch**: `003-when-we-go`
**Created**: Wednesday, September 10, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "when we go to the next page can we add more status or progress messages so that it first scans the full file structure to get the list of files in the director of the repo, then provides the count of the files in the repo and files not considered."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, after configuring the VS Code extension on the first page and navigating to the subsequent page within the same repository, I want to see clear progress messages indicating the file scanning process, including the total number of files scanned and the number of files not considered, so I understand the system's activity and status.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user has completed the initial configuration on the first page of the VS Code extension and navigates to the subsequent page, **When** the file scanning process begins, **Then** a status message indicating "Scanning full file structure..." is displayed.
2. **Given** the file scanning is in progress, **When** the initial scan is complete, **Then** a progress message showing "Scanned X files in the repository, Y files not considered." is displayed, where X is the count of files in the repo and Y is the count of files not considered.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the repository is empty? answer: so when the repo is empty it just moves onto the next page and show its complete. then we're presented with the search bar so that we can query the db and find the files.
- How does the system handle very large repositories with millions of files? answer: it will take a long time to scan the files, but it will eventually complete.
- What if there are no files "not considered"? answer: it will show 0 files not considered.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a status message when initiating a full file structure scan.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST identify and count all files within the repository's directory.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST identify and count files that are "not considered" (e.g., ignored by `.gitignore`, `.geminiignore`, or other exclusion rules).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST display the total count of files in the repository.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST display the count of files "not considered".
- **FR-006**: The status/progress messages MUST be updated dynamically as the scanning progresses.

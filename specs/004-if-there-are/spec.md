# Feature Specification: Robust Tree-Sitter Parsing and Persistent Configuration

**Feature Branch**: `004-if-there-are`
**Created**: September 10, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "If there are syntax errors when parsing the files that have tree sitters setup, can we skip them and process code chunk. Also when we save the configuration from the first page, it seems that it keeps asking us to reset the configurations every time. Is it possible to plan a local .context/config.json which contains the settings and we check if that exists so that we can load it. We also check if there is a gitignore file and if has the .context/config.json in there, if not, we add it. If no gitignore then we create it"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want the system to gracefully handle syntax errors in files during tree-sitter parsing so that the indexing process doesn't halt and other valid code can still be processed. I also want my configuration settings to be saved persistently in a local file and automatically ignored by Git, so I don't have to reset them every time and avoid committing personal settings. Furthermore, this config file should include the index of the Qdrant we'll be using so that we can refer to it when we load the app. If the index cannot be found but the settings for Ollama and Qdrant are valid, I expect reindexing to be done. Otherwise, if the config.json is all good and the index is found, I should be presented with the page to search the database.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a file with syntax errors is present in the project, **When** the tree-sitter parsing runs, **Then** the system skips the erroneous file, logs the error, and continues processing other valid files/code chunks.
2. **Given** I modify configuration settings in the application, **When** I save the configuration, **Then** the settings are stored in a local `.context/config.json` file, including the Qdrant index information.
3. **Given** a `.context/config.json` file exists with valid Ollama and Qdrant settings but no Qdrant index information or an invalid index, **When** the application starts, **Then** the application triggers a reindexing process.
4. **Given** a `.context/config.json` file exists with valid Ollama and Qdrant settings and a valid Qdrant index, **When** the application starts, **Then** the application presents the user with the database search page.
5. **Given** `.gitignore` does not contain `.context/config.json`, **When** the configuration is saved, **Then** `.context/config.json` is added to `.gitignore`.
6. **Given** `.gitignore` does not exist, **When** the configuration is saved, **Then** a new `.gitignore` file is created with `.context/config.json` added to it.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a file contains only syntax errors and no valid code chunks?
- How does the system handle concurrent writes to `.context/config.json` (if applicable)?
- What happens if `.context/config.json` is corrupted or unreadable?
- What if the user explicitly wants to track `.context/config.json` (though this is generally discouraged)?
- What if Ollama or Qdrant settings are invalid when the index is not found?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST skip files with syntax errors during tree-sitter parsing.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST continue processing valid code chunks even if other files have syntax errors.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST save configuration settings to a local file named `.context/config.json`.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST load configuration settings from `.context/config.json` on startup.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST add `.context/config.json` to `.gitignore` if it's not already present.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST create a `.gitignore` file if it does not exist and add `.context/config.json` to it.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST store the Qdrant index information in `.context/config.json`.
- **FR-008**: If the Qdrant index is not found in `.context/config.json` but Ollama and Qdrant settings are valid, the system MUST trigger a reindexing process.
- **FR-009**: If `.context/config.json` is valid and the Qdrant index is found, the system MUST present the user with the database search page.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Configuration**: Represents the application settings, stored persistently. Attributes include various user preferences, operational parameters, and Qdrant Index Information.
- **File**: Represents a source code file being parsed. Attributes include its content and path.

# Feature Specification: Indexing Error Fix and Enhanced Search Webview

**Feature Branch**: `001-in-this-feature`
**Created**: 2025-09-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "In this feature we need to fix 'Errors encountered: Indexing failed: Parallel processing timeout' and then we want to update our project webview's page for the searching the repo. This page should have a search bar, below that a button to search the qdrant, and then at the top of the page there's a progress bar and a status update which shows progress or shows changes in the db so if there are new files the background tasks in the src/ would process these new files into the db by either inserting, deleting or updating the qdrant. When the user search a text it will then present a list of the files that are related to the query. It should also just show unique files and not duplicate entries, it should also show the % of relatibility to the query. Just below the search button we would like the files down, you may need to truncate the path, and put them in little boxes or something to make it look nice. We should also have the ability to copy the list of files in the following format for now: `--include "file1.py, test/file2.py"` it should concatenate and separate them via a comma. We click that button below the search so that we can copy the listed files. It should be relative to the root of the repo."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to efficiently search the repository, see the progress of background indexing tasks, and easily copy relevant file paths so that I can quickly find and utilize information within the codebase.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the webview page is loaded, **When** background indexing tasks are running, **Then** the progress bar and status update should accurately reflect the indexing status (inserting, deleting, or updating files in Qdrant).
2. **Given** the webview page is loaded and indexing is complete, **When** I enter a search query into the search bar and click the search button, **Then** a list of unique, relevant files should be displayed, each with its percentage of relevance to the query.
3. **Given** a list of relevant files is displayed, **When** I click the "copy listed files" button, **Then** the relative paths of the displayed files should be copied to the clipboard in the format `--include "file1.py, test/file2.py"`.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Qdrant search returns no results?
- How does the system handle very long file paths in the displayed list?
- What happens if the background indexing encounters an unrecoverable error?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST fix the "Indexing failed: Parallel processing timeout" error.
- **FR-002**: The webview page MUST display a search bar.
- **FR-003**: The webview page MUST display a button to initiate a search against Qdrant.
- **FR-004**: The webview page MUST display a progress bar and status updates reflecting background indexing tasks (inserting, deleting, updating files in Qdrant).
- **FR-005**: The system MUST process new, deleted, or updated files from `src/` into Qdrant in the background.
- **FR-006**: When a user searches, the system MUST present a list of unique files related to the query.
- **FR-007**: The displayed file list MUST include the percentage of relatability for each file to the query.
- **FR-008**: The displayed file paths MUST be truncated if necessary and presented in a visually appealing manner (e.g., "little boxes").
- **FR-009**: The webview page MUST include a button to copy the listed files.
- **FR-010**: The copied file list MUST be in the format `--include "file1.py, test/file2.py"`, with relative paths separated by commas.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **File**: Represents a file in the repository, with attributes like path, content, and relevance score.
- **Qdrant**: The vector database storing indexed file information.
- **Search Query**: The text entered by the user to find relevant files.

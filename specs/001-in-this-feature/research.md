# Phase 0 Research: Indexing Error Fix and Enhanced Search Webview

## Unknowns from Technical Context

### Performance Goals
- **Research Task**: Research common performance goals for repository indexing and search features.
- **Decision**: Key performance goals include:
    - **Indexing Throughput**: Rate of content processing and indexing.
    - **Indexing Latency**: Delay between content change and searchability.
    - **Search Latency (Query Response Time)**: Time to return search results.
    - **Search Throughput**: Number of queries handled per unit of time.
    - **Relevance**: Quality of search results matching user intent.
    - **Resource Utilization**: Efficient use of CPU, memory, disk I/O, network.
    - **Scalability**: Ability to handle increasing data and query load.
    - **Fault Tolerance/Availability**: System's resilience to failures.
    - **Index Size**: Disk space consumed by the index.
- **Rationale**: These goals ensure an efficient, responsive, and reliable indexing and search system.
- **Alternatives considered**: N/A

### Constraints
- **Research Task**: Research common constraints for repository indexing and search features, especially related to large codebases and real-time updates.
- **Decision**: Common constraints include:
    - **Scalability**: Handling massive volumes of code and files.
    - **Real-time Updates/Low Latency**: Reflecting changes with minimal delay.
    - **Indexing Performance**: Keeping up with change rates.
    - **Search Performance/Low Latency**: Quick query responses across vast indexes.
    - **Accuracy and Relevance**: High-quality search results.
    - **Resource Consumption**: Managing intensive CPU, memory, I/O.
    - **Fault Tolerance and Reliability**: System resilience to failures.
    - **Security and Access Control**: Adhering to permission models.
    - **Data Consistency**: Maintaining index consistency with repository state.
    - **Schema Flexibility/Evolution**: Adapting to new data types and languages.
    - **Language Agnosticism/Support for Multiple Languages**: Processing diverse codebases.
    - **Cost**: Operational expenses.
- **Rationale**: These constraints highlight the challenges in building robust indexing and search systems for large, dynamic codebases.
- **Alternatives considered**: N/A

### Parallel Processing Timeout Error
- **Research Task**: Research best practices for handling 'Parallel processing timeout' errors in indexing systems.
- **Decision**: Best practices for handling 'Parallel processing timeout' errors include:
    - **Prevention Strategies**:
        - Optimize Indexing Processes (Incremental Data Pulls, Batching, Query Optimization, Efficient Code).
        - Properly Size and Scale Infrastructure (Resource Allocation, Sharding/Partitioning, Add More Servers).
        - Tune Timeout Values (Appropriate Settings, Context-Aware Timeouts, Dynamic Adjustment).
    - **Detection and Monitoring**:
        - Comprehensive Logging.
        - Alerting.
        - Monitoring Tools.
        - Index Monitor/Status.
    - **Error Handling and Recovery**:
        - Retries with Exponential Backoff.
        - Circuit Breaker Pattern.
        - Idempotency.
        - Graceful Degradation and Fallback.
        - Handling Partial Failures (Skip Failed Items, Isolate Failures, Manual Upload/Re-indexing).
        - Database Connection Management.
    - **Design Considerations**:
        - Distributed Tracing.
        - Asynchronous Processing.
        - Concurrency Control.
- **Rationale**: These practices provide a comprehensive approach to prevent, detect, and recover from parallel processing timeouts, ensuring system stability and data integrity.
- **Alternatives considered**: N/A

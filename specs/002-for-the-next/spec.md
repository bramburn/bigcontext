# Feature Specification: Enhanced Indexing and File Monitoring

**Feature Branch**: `002-for-the-next`
**Created**: 2025-09-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "for the next phase that we want to do is be able to pause and resume the index while it is being indexed obviously and it will continue to do that and one of the things that we need to consider is also if the user changes the embedding model or the database it needs to be re indexed so we need to have some kind of validation logic in there in the background that resets the whole thing and the status of the index. Now the other thing that we need to do is be able to monitor file changes in the repo we can hook into the VS code API and be able to monitor those and be able to automatically update the relevant database entry for that file itself and we should be able to consider not only the files that we have in the system using tree sitter but also the ones that are outside of it which could be a new language that we haven't implemented the tree sitter but still chunks it out into number of lines or whatever so for example you know it could be a markdown file for for example that we could have and we want to include that into the embedding so that we know what's going on in the project Obviously there's embeddings for Markdown might not be super valuable but it still gives us context about the project itself and content of the project. But it needs to ensure that it excludes things such as files in the git ignore so we don't pick up things like the node modules folder which includes so many files the thing that we need to consider also is not picking up binary file and large files I might have a million or so chunks into it or because the file is such a huge so it needs to consider those kind of limitations in there to consider. we need to ensure that we actually review what's already there in the existing code to avoid duplication and refactor them where needed. make sure you understand the project structure first!"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using this extension, I want the indexing to be more robust and dynamic. I want to be able to pause and resume indexing, have the system automatically re-index when I change core configurations, and have it automatically keep the index up-to-date as I modify files in my workspace, so that the context provided by the extension is always accurate and I have more control over the resource usage.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** the indexing process is in progress, **When** I click a "Pause" button, **Then** the indexing process is halted.
2.  **Given** the indexing process is paused, **When** I click a "Resume" button, **Then** the indexing process continues from where it left off.
3.  **Given** the indexing is complete, **When** I change the embedding model in the settings, **Then** the system initiates a full re-index of the workspace.
4.  **Given** a file is already indexed, **When** I modify and save it, **Then** the system automatically re-indexes only that file.
5.  **Given** a new file is added to the project, **When** I save it, **Then** the system automatically indexes it.
6.  **Given** a file is deleted from the project, **Then** its corresponding entries are removed from the index.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if VS Code is closed while indexing is paused?
- How does the system handle a very large number of file changes at once (e.g., switching branches)?
- What happens if a file is modified but the content remains the same?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a mechanism for users to pause an ongoing indexing process.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide a mechanism for users to resume a paused indexing process.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST detect changes to the configured embedding model and trigger a full re-index.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST detect changes to the database configuration and trigger a full re-index.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST monitor the workspace for file creation events and automatically index the new files.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST monitor the workspace for file modification events and automatically update the index for the changed files.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST monitor the workspace for file deletion events and automatically remove the corresponding data from the index.
- **FR-008**: The file monitoring system MUST respect the patterns listed in the project's `.gitignore` file.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST be able to process and chunk text-based files that do not have a corresponding Tree-sitter parser (e.g., Markdown).
- **FR-010**: The system MUST avoid indexing binary files.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST have a mechanism to avoid indexing excessively large files. A default limit of 2MB will be used, and this limit should be configurable in the extension's settings.
- **FR-012**: The system state MUST reflect the current status of the index (e.g., "Indexing", "Paused", "Up-to-date").

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
-   **IndexState**: Represents the current status of the indexing process (e.g., Idle, Indexing, Paused, Error).
-   **FileMetadata**: Represents an indexed file, including its path, last modification timestamp, and hash to detect changes.

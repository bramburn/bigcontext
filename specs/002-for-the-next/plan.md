# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Indexing and File Monitoring

**Branch**: `002-for-the-next` | **Date**: 2025-09-09 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/bramburn/dev/bigcontext/specs/002-for-the-next/spec.md`

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of an enhanced indexing and file monitoring system. The system will introduce pausable indexing, automatic re-indexing on configuration changes, and real-time index updates based on file system events. The implementation will follow a test-driven development (TDD) approach using `vitest` and will be broken down into atomic, verifiable tasks.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: VS Code API, glob
**Storage**: Qdrant (vector database)
**Testing**: vitest
**Target Platform**: VS Code Extension
**Project Type**: Single project (VS Code Extension)
**Constraints**: Must respect `.gitignore`, avoid binary/large files.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (VS Code Extension)
- Using framework directly? Yes (VS Code API)
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- The new services (`IndexingService`, `FileMonitorService`) will be implemented as modular components within the existing `src/services` directory, following the established pattern.

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle will be enforced. All tests will be written using `vitest`.
- Order: Contract→Integration→Unit will be followed.

**Observability**:
- Structured logging will be added for the new services.

**Versioning**:
- N/A for this feature branch.

# Feature Specification: RAG for LLM VS Code Extension with Initial Setup and Indexing UI

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-currently-have`  
**Created**: Tuesday, September 9, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we currently have a VS code extension that has RAG for LLM and what it's supposed to do is chunk the whole project including markdown files and exclude any binary files in that sense and regular files that are in the git ignore so we shouldn't be considering files and get ignore and we should be able to do first have a page in our first view one opening up the The Escort extension to set up the settings for the application Because we obviously need a embedding model such as Mimic Embed or Open AI and we want the user to provide the details and create shows that have that and the setting second setting is the ability for us to put the and store the embeddings to a database and what we're using at the moment is qdrant. We want to have the first visual page to have this settings,. if the setting is not there then we are presented with that form but if the setting is saved and stored properly then we will use that information and it should display a kind of a progress bar at the top of the application and it shows how much has been indexed and has a button to say start index or start A reindexing depending on the status of the index so if it has been indexed in the past then it would say start reindexing and it would tell you how many chunks and some basic statistics And I believe at the moment we're using fluent UI and I want you to continue to use that but really improve on the user experience at the moment I want you just to focus on this kind of two or 3 workflow that we have and I want you to reshuffle the project and files for this VS code extension"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a VS Code extension user, I want to easily configure the RAG for LLM extension's embedding model and Qdrant database settings upon first use, so that I can then initiate and monitor the project indexing process and leverage the RAG capabilities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** the VS Code extension is installed and opened for the first time, **When** the user activates the extension, **Then** a visual page is presented to configure embedding model and Qdrant database settings.
2.  **Given** the settings configuration page is displayed, **When** the user provides valid embedding model (e.g., OpenAI API key) and Qdrant database details (e.g., host, port), and saves them, **Then** the settings are stored, and the indexing progress view is displayed.
3.  **Given** the settings are saved and the indexing progress view is displayed, **When** the project has not been indexed before, **Then** a progress bar is shown, indicating 0% indexed, along with a "Start Indexing" button and basic statistics like "0 chunks indexed".
4.  **Given** the settings are saved and the indexing progress view is displayed, **When** the project has been partially or fully indexed, **Then** a progress bar shows the current indexing percentage, along with a "Start Reindexing" button, the number of chunks indexed, and other basic statistics.
5.  **Given** the indexing progress view is displayed, **When** the user clicks "Start Indexing" or "Start Reindexing", **Then** the indexing process begins, the progress bar updates in real-time, and the chunk count and statistics are refreshed.
6.  **Given** the extension is active and settings are saved, **When** the user opens the extension view again, **Then** the indexing progress view is displayed directly, showing the current status.

### Edge Cases
-   What happens when the user provides invalid embedding model credentials or Qdrant connection details?
-   How does the system handle large projects during chunking and indexing?
-   What happens if the Qdrant database becomes unavailable during indexing?
-   How does the system handle files that are part of `.gitignore` or are binary files during chunking?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
-   **FR-001**: The extension MUST present a dedicated visual page for initial setup of embedding model and Qdrant database settings if settings are not found.
-   **FR-002**: The extension MUST allow users to select between Nomic Embed and OpenAI as embedding model providers.
-   **FR-003**: The extension MUST capture and store configuration details for the selected embedding model. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific configuration details are required for Mimic Embed and OpenAI (e.g., API key, endpoint, model name)?]
-   **FR-004**: The extension MUST capture and store configuration details for connecting to a Qdrant database. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific configuration details are required for Qdrant (e.g., host, port, API key, collection name)?]
-   **FR-005**: The extension MUST persist the configured settings across VS Code sessions.
-   **FR-006**: The extension MUST, upon successful configuration, display a progress bar indicating the indexing status of the project.
-   **FR-007**: The extension MUST display the percentage of the project that has been indexed.
-   **FR-008**: The extension MUST display the total number of chunks indexed.
-   **FR-009**: The extension MUST display additional basic statistics related to indexing. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What "basic statistics" are desired beyond chunk count (e.g., total files, time taken, errors)?]
-   **FR-010**: The extension MUST provide a "Start Indexing" button if the project has not been indexed.
-   **FR-011**: The extension MUST provide a "Start Reindexing" button if the project has been previously indexed.
-   **FR-012**: The extension MUST, upon user initiation, chunk the entire project, including markdown files.
-   **FR-013**: The extension MUST exclude binary files from the chunking process.
-   **FR-014**: The extension MUST exclude files specified in `.gitignore` from the chunking process.
-   **FR-015**: The extension MUST store the generated embeddings in the configured Qdrant database.
-   **FR-016**: The extension's UI MUST adhere to Fluent UI design principles.
-   **FR-017**: The extension's UI MUST provide an improved user experience for the initial setup and indexing workflows.
-   **FR-018**: The project structure and files MUST be reshuffled to support the new workflows and improved UX. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific reshuffling of project files is desired?]
-   **FR-019**: The extension MUST focus on the initial setup and indexing workflows. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The prompt mentions "two or 3 workflow". What is the third workflow, if any, to focus on?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
-   **Embedding Model Settings**: Represents the configuration for the chosen embedding provider (e.g., API key, endpoint).
-   **Qdrant Database Settings**: Represents the connection details for the Qdrant instance (e.g., host, port, collection name).
-   **Indexing Progress Data**: Represents the current state of the project indexing (e.g., percentage complete, chunk count, status).
-   **Project Files**: Represents the files within the VS Code workspace that are subject to chunking and indexing.

# Quickstart: Vitest Test Refactoring Validation

This document outlines the quickstart steps to validate the successful refactoring of Vitest tests.

## Test Scenarios:

### User Story 1: Accurate Test Suite Reflection
**Description**: As a developer, I want the Vitest test suite to accurately reflect the correctness of the codebase, with all tests passing, so that I can confidently develop and refactor features.
**Scenario**: Run `npx vitest` and observe all tests passing.

### User Story 2: Webview-React Component Test Environment
**Description**: As a developer, I want `webview-react/` component tests to run in a browser-like environment without `window is not defined` errors, so that I can reliably test frontend logic.
**Scenario**: Execute `webview-react/` tests and confirm no `window is not defined` or `document is not defined` errors.

### User Story 3: Correct Vitest Global Setup/Teardown
**Description**: As a developer, I want `src/test/suite/` tests to correctly recognize Vitest's global setup/teardown functions, so that test setup is consistent and reliable.
**Scenario**: Execute `src/test/suite/` tests and confirm no `setup is not defined` or `suiteSetup is not defined` errors.

### User Story 4: Correct Mocking and Assertions
**Description**: As a developer, I want tests with mocking to correctly apply mocks and pass assertions, so that I can trust the isolation and correctness of unit tests.
**Scenario**: Execute tests with mocking (e.g., `qdrantService.test.ts`, `configChange.test.ts`, `fileMonitorService.test.ts`, `indexingService.test.ts`) and confirm correct mock application and passing assertions.

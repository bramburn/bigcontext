# Feature Specification: Address Vitest Failures in src/ Extension Files

**Feature Branch**: `005-review-the-current`  
**Created**: Thursday, September 11, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "review the current project, run the vitest for the src/ extension files and see if they are passing, if not gather all the files related to the error, and prepare a specification to fix it"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to ensure the `src/` extension files are free of Vitest test failures so that the project's core functionality is stable and reliable.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the project is set up, **When** Vitest tests are run for `src/` extension files, **Then** the test results are reported, indicating passing or failing tests.
2. **Given** Vitest tests for `src/` extension files have failed, **When** the system identifies and gathers all files related to the errors, **Then** a comprehensive list of problematic files is provided.
3. **Given** problematic files have been identified due to Vitest failures, **When** a specification is prepared to address and fix these issues, **Then** the specification clearly outlines the necessary steps for resolution.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if no Vitest tests are found for `src/` extension files?
- How does the system handle intermittent test failures (flaky tests)?
- What if the error is not directly related to a specific file but a broader configuration issue?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST execute Vitest tests specifically for files within the `src/` extension directory.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST report the outcome of the Vitest execution, indicating which tests passed and which failed.
- **FR-003**: If Vitest tests fail, the system MUST identify and list all source files directly implicated in the failures (e.g., files with failing tests, or files that are dependencies of failing tests).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST generate a preliminary specification document outlining the identified issues and proposing a high-level plan for their resolution.
- **FR-005**: The generated specification MUST include details about the failing tests and the associated files.
